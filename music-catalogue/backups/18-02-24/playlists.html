I took the worm and man I ate
Killed my number out at the farm
Then they sent me back with more ink than arm

Hand stuck deep in a bucket of chum
Gumbo hot in a bayou sun
Half a yard a week pulling craw from the mud
My eyes are blue but not my blood

A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
Just enough liquor to cut it up nice

There's something singing inside my brain
Sweet the yeast so I'm feeding it grain
Copper coiling down my spine
And the venom burns and venom's mine

Under the swamp the french did rot
Wine for the cypress then hacked into table tops
Holding meals for the bellies of the free
Drilling holes in the gulf and snorting rails through a fifty

A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
Just enough liquor to cut it up nice

Past the meadow where the white tail rut
Behind the walls of a tin wall hut
Honey girl's cooking red devil lye
And I want my slice of american pie

Voodoo man rolls up in a coupe de ville
Nothing but a punk and a detroit grill
Grackles crackle their chalkboard song
I'm feeling good ya I'm feeling strong

A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
Just enough liquor to cut it up nice

Gut the buck and hang the rack
Spark a rock and your eyes go soot black
Stick the poor boys in the sand
Bring 'em back in a box and cue the band

I shove it all in a gunny sack
Into the trunk of my brand new cadillac
Only six hours to space city
They're hungry there and the girls are pretty

A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
A fifth of whiskey and a bowie knife
Just enough liquor to cut it up nice</td>

I am crack
I ain't lyin', kick a lion in his crack
I'm the shit, I will fall off in your crib, take a shit
Pinch your momma on the booty
Kick your dog, fuck your bitch
Fat boy dressed up like he's Santa
And took pictures with your kids

We the best
We will cut a frowny face in your chest, little wench
I'm unmentionably fresh, I'm a mensch, get correct
I will walk into a court while erect, screaming "Yes!

Nobody speak, nobody get choked

Get running
Start pumping your bunions, I'm coming
I'm the dumbest, who flamethrow your function to Funyuns
Flame your crew quicker than Trump fucks his youngest
Now face the flame, fuckers, your fame and fate's done with

I rob Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Linus and Lucy
Put coke in the doobie, roll woolies to smoke with Snoopy
I still remain that dick grabbin' slacker that spit a loogie
Cause the toter of the toolie'll murder you friggin' Moolies
Fuck outta here, yeah

Baby duck if it quacks, with a Ruger
Top billin', come cops some villainous shots is blocked
Shipped out, and bought, and y'all feeling it
El-P killin' it, Killer Mike killin' shit

What more can I say? We top billin' it
Valiant without villainy
Viciously foul victory
Burn towns and villages
Burning looting and pillaging

Murderers try to hurt us we curse them and all their children
I just want the bread and bologna bundles to tuck away
I don't work for free, I am barely giving a fuck away

So tell beggin' Johnny and Mommy to get the fuck away
Heyyo here's a gun, son, now run, get it the gutterway
Live to shoot another day

Pull up in the dinger, straight through the hole in the floor
We&#8217;re the toddlers, don't know what you thought
By the end of the night, you&#8217;ll be picking up your jaw
Plants, not ten or twenty
Run up in the crop gaff with Eggs Benny (Agh)
Mans 'ead got cracked and his legs went jelly (Blow)

[Verse 1]
Just know that we're leaving the room with every last penny
No joke, man don't boast
Just know it's over when you see Ghost
Spinning back kick might take off your nose
Man don't want that smoke
Big elbow to the top of the dome (What?)
Man don't want that smoke, nah
And I'm Ernie, the left hand's fast but the right hand's sturdy
They know I been bad from early
Your likkle 'eadlock can't hurt me
I'm fighting dirty, Jim (Chin)
You already know man can't fuck with him
When it comes to this fighting ting, manna head butt him (Yeah)

Just know that we come from the bottom of the slum
And we're hungry, means we're coming for the crumbs
And we're like a taxman, cah we're coming for your funds
Bang, bang, you see us in a gang
Hop out the back of the blue transit van (Yeah)
Nuff man have never had money in a bank
With these 25 grand in elastic bands (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We've always got drastic plans, like Bill Sykes we&#8217;ll take your pots and pans (Yeah)
How many million views did we do last week?
Man I got too many fans (What?)

That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge

Read between the lines
What's f*cked up and everything's all right

Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone

I walk alone

Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
[Verse 1]
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Herm&#232;s link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, s?llin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knif? to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo ho if yo bitch keep eyein' me!

Ayo, I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me

"Drive Safe" really 'bout to lose all its meanin' now
Guess you love to travel when I pull up, man, you're leavin' town

Ridin' around with homies like we run the city, done it

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
"Fools," said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence"</td>

She was 3 years older than me, but in no time we became friends
We'd listen to her mix tapes; Dead Can Dance, Felt, This Mortal Coil...
She introduced me to her favourite books, gave me clothes, and my first cigarette
Sometimes we would head down to Blackbirds moor to watch the barges on Grand Union in the twilight
She said "The water has no memory"
For a few months everything about our lives was perfect
It was only us, we were inseparable
But gradually she passed into another distant part of my memory
Until I could no longer remember her face, her voice, even her name

We have got, we have got the perfect life</td>

Blown on the steel breeze.

Come on you stranger, you legend,
You martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon,
You cried for the moon.

Threatened by shadows at night,
And exposed to the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.

With random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper,
You prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and
I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child,
You winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion,
and shine!</td>

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Oh why, oh why can't I?

Oh someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I, I?

Translation
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick - ha ha!
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin

(Swifty)
Bitch it's too late

(Eminem)
Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

(Swifty)
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin, creatin murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face {*BLAM*}
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin every penny - it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin, I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin me they bracelets
Chillin in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin - throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

(Eminem)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

(Bizarre)
I'm a compulsive liar, settin my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?) Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*}
Lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*}
Lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*} (Damn!)
{*DJ reverses the record and scratches it back on beat*}
I'm fuckin anything when I'm snortin
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
{*dog whines*} Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin ass mom

(Proof)
Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin {*gun cocks*} nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin, get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
and found chopped up in a trash bag

(Kuniva)
We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell
cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a "Luni"
I got a "Yukmouth" and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin "Kuniva yo yo."
I leave ya face leakin, run up in church
and smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

(Kon Artis)
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
(Special delivery!) I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin in dough

(Eminem)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

(Eminem)
Haha. suck my motherfuckin dick
D-12. Dirty motherfuckin Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre Kid
Swifty McVeigh
The Kon Artis
The Kuniva
Dirty Harry
Haha, and Slim Shady</td>

I might have went too far
Helping to contribute to makin' they're job hard
Serving feels like these people ain't no enemy
I can't believe I'm out here killin' my community

If you knew how far I came
From where I am and where I use to be
Don't want it, you can tell by the look at me
This gangster life ain't no longer in me and I'm

I know there's things I could've change girl
I know there's things I could've done a lot better
Instead I'm in the streets, tryna make that cheddar
Thinking in my mind that you gon' be there for ever

I know I coulda let it all go
But I was thinking it would make life better
Instead I'm sitting in my cell writing this letter

Thought I wouldn't get caught 'cause I was way too clever

I learned there's no one to catch you when you're falling
And there'll be no one to hear you when you calling
Do you know what it's like to wake up in the morning
While you're starving you hearing bugs crawling

Reminiscin' on them days you was walking
With pretty women on your arm while you're flossing
Thankful that I didn't end up in a coffin'
Some see too often

Tired of the runnin'

I said I'm tired, so tired, yeah

'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating

When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms.Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
f*ck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, f*ck you Debbie

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

'Cause it feels so empty, without me

Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass

And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me? Well I'm back

Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting

Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36 year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno

Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene

No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there

But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe

If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy

It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change

Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain

Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life

You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley

How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit

Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely

We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain

Watch the butterflies, hit the wall,

Weed, it takes the stress away,

It's nuffing but the sticky, icky, green stuff!
Line it, pass it and take a puff!
Having a bad day, stop by my house,
coz most likely, I've got a blunt in my mouth.
So sit down relax and chill,

Nah, baby, I don't smoke no porks,

Wide out the raps, blowing in my lap,
Rap hennesy, keep the acid tap.
I'm glad, that I didnt't go down south,
Take care of my kids, be the man of the house,
orange mushrooms, and yellow stars,
Fat bags of weed[???]
Get in and lap, come on jump in,
Raid a bottle of gin, and two of your freaky friends
O f*ck it! Let's go to see the point,
Bring your son alone, shit, he can hit the joint,
Cause rapping, it's a full time job!
All I wanna smoke weed and praise God!

[Chorus:]
I wake up praising, God every day,

And I swear-wear
This is tru-u-ue

Dirty bit!

Welcome! This is The Beginning
For every ending is a mega starter
When they bring the dark
We bring the life, let's go</td>

Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason

Ain't nothing i would rather do
Going down

My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs

Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel

Nobody's gonna mess me round
Hey satan

Playing in a rocking band
Hey momma

I'm on my way to the promised land

Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long I'm glad to be back [I bet you know I'm...]
Yes, I'm let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I've been looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild
CHORUS:
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
(Well) I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Back in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang
With a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
CHORUS
Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well I'm back in black

Well I'm back, I'm back

Ohh yeah

Oooh yeah, yeah Oh yeah

Cheh

[Styles P]
This shit is crazy
Crazy

[Akon]
It's one of those things man
You gotta experience to know what I'm talkin' about
Ha ha
It's where the goin' get rough

Let's go
Konvict

[Akon]
We in too deep to turn back now D

[Styles P]
Sure is

[Akon]
Watch yourself
Before you get
Blown away

[Styles P]
You know where I come from
The place where your fate is a mic
Or a bull or a dum dum
A jail cell a pine box
And brothers is dumb young
Young boys
Still bustin' guns for the slum
that they come from
Cops is the only ones they gonna run from
That's it
They puttin' they hood up
But 9 out of 10 of us ain't got good luck
You're gonna ride on a man and catch 25
Or get hit and get sent to the other side
You lose both sides of the coin
So me I play the hood baby
Not in the
Mama got a little church I could join
But I didn't go yet
Man got a mosque I could join
But I didn't go yet
Cool with the devil on my back
I'm in cold sweats
'bout to do some dirt
In some dirty black old sweats
If you known you should've shown the way
Most of the hood bout to get blown away

[Chorus (Akon):]
'cause I was raised up to show no fear
Cowardly hearts'll never last long here

If you ain't man enough to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
'cause I done seen the block break down tears
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years
Tryin' not to get blown away

See I ain't never shot nobody
But I'm known for fightin'
So when I strike man
You'll think you been struck by lightning
Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga
Even a child could take a life pulling the trigger
Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion
See your target in the distance and keep on blastin'
They say guns don't kill people, people do
So when you're hit man
You feel that shit the evils do
Can't see myself get beat down
My eyes swollen
Mom's cryin' they don't know what happened
My pride's stolen
If I ain't got my heat then I got a blade
That hit you off

[Chorus (Akon)]

Keep my eye out for jakes
Ears to the streets
Other eye out for snakes
And these scandalous freaks
If we ain't on good terms
Don't bother to speak
Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me
Same thing'll make you laugh it'll make you cry
This quiet nigga, he'll take you life
Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice
If somebody else could travel
Through the tunnel of life
Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there
When you're ridin'
But I'll stay to myself
So if you see me out there
with a bear we fightin'
Then nigga go help the bear

Handful of niggers and they all got G's
So you lookin' at me now what it's gonna be
Just another a tease far as I can see
Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs

Throwin' about 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that
'Cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala used to move 'phetamines

I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know I wanna love you
you already know I wanna love you

Mobbin' through the club in the low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker section

Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me but I can see you
It's cool we jet, the mood is set, your is so wet
You're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you're humpin' and jumpin', your is bouncin'
You're smilin' and grinning and lookin' at me
Girl and while you lookin' at me, I'm ready to hit the catty
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the catty

Baby you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything and that? s kinda scary
'Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin' got me tippin' my glass

Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

Men steady comin' after you, women steady comin' after me
Seems like e'rybody wanna go for self and don't wanna respect boundary

Tellin' you all those lies just to get on your side

But just know that I tried to always apologize
And I'ma have you first always in my heart to keep you satisfied

Got every right to wanna leave, you got every right to wanna go
You got every right to hit the road and never talk to me no more
You don't even have to call, even check for me at all
Because the way I been actin' lately has been off the wall

Especially towards you, puttin' girls before you

And they watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you baby

Gotta get my block sold up... u know me
Gotta get my block sold up... u know me

E'yo gringo e'yo gringo

Or some pure white coca
E'yo gringo e'yo gringo
See I never been a smoker
I'm just ur neighborhood dealer

And I'm tryin' to keep my block sold up...

See I woke up early as hell one morning
And I noticed my stash was half gone
'Cause these feen's can't stop smokin' ma rocks
'Cause around my way these nigga's been worry
Fighting for territory that's mine
'Cause these cats can't stop live 'cause of my shots
I'ma show you right now I'm reason the block is moving
I got dubs at the price of a dime
That's why I'm on top and I won't stop
'Cause I get it so cheap no matter what I won't be losing
Re-up spots is so hard to find
But I got one
Cool ass Mexican man

E'yo gringo e'yo gringo
I heard you wan some marijuana
Or some pure white coca
E'yo gringo e'yo gringo
See I never been a smoker

You can find me on the other side of the border
Where the 100 grand in my pocket
For the first trip jus' pack a lil somethin'
'Cause I'ma bring the work back by the air
Or even by water
Whatever it take to get to the crib
Gotta play it safe 'cause they out there
See I got so much client ale waiting
I can't just make one trip
But I gotta get enough to supply the sibling
But I gotta be careful smugglin' in
Vaseline rapped around so it hide the sent
While I wait Jose
He'll bring it to me

E'yo gringo e'yo gringo
I heard you wan some marijuana
Or some pure white coca
E'yo gringo e'yo gringo

Akon
Slim Shady

I see the one, because she be that lady! Hey!
I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)
I see it dull and backed now
I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!

I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

[Chorus (2x)]
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

[Eminem:]

Ooh...Looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a lil drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it!
Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my woodie back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, she's like "You're!"
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
Plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playing
"Akon!"

[Akon:]
I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

Eminem is rollin', d and em rollin' bo
And all marvelous them rolling
Women just holding big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwing "D!"
Hitting on less than "Three!"
Block wheel style like "Whee!"
Girl I can tell you want me because lately

I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her

Como puede ser verdad

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Refrain:

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me

Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

(refrain)

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

(refrain x 2)

La la la la la la la
Te dijo te amo
La la la la la la la
El dijo que te ama</td>

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Everywhere I go
I'm always hearin' your name
And no matter where I'm at
Girl you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane
Or a car or a train
No other girl's in my brain
And you the one to blame

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars &amp; B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted (Why?)
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na&#8212;na&#8212;na&#8212;nothin' on you, baby, na&#8212;nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na&#8212;na&#8212;na&#8212;nothin' on you, baby, na&#8212;nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hello)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na&#8212;na&#8212;na&#8212;nothin' on you, baby, na&#8212;nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na&#8212;na&#8212;na&#8212;nothin' on you, baby, na&#8212;nothin' on you

Title: "Shut Up"

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

We try'n to take it slow, but we still losin' control

Ya we try to make it work, but its still is the worst

And I'm craaazayyy, tryin' to be your laaaadayyy

I think I'm goin' craaaazay

Girl, me and you was just fine, ya know

We wine'd and dinned

did them things that couples do when in love, ya know

walks on the beach and stuff, ya know

Things that lova's say and do

"I love you boo", "I love you to"

"I miss you alot", "I miss you even more, thas why I flew you out when we were on tour"

But then somethin' got outta hand, you start yellin' why I was gripmans

Even though I had legitamate reasons(o sh*t)

You know I have to make them dividends(o sh*t)

How could you trust the private eye's girl

Thas why you dont believe my lies, and to quick to resent 

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

We try'n to take it slow, but we still losin' control

Ya we try to make it work, but its still is the worst

And I'm craaazayyy, tryin' to be your laaaadayyy

I think I'm goin' craaaazay

Why do we gotta move so fast

lova's part before you could make it last

Why is it that you just lose control

every time we agree on takin' it slow

So why does it havta be so d@mn tough

Cause fools like us could never get enough of love

Showin' the love that you be givin'

Changin' up your livin' for another transition

Goin' into submission

Tryin' to get you to listen

To be mad at each other has become out tradition

You yell, I yell, everybody yells

We got neighbors across the street sayin' ("WHO THE HELL")

Who the hell, what the hell's goin' down

To much of the bickering, kill it with the sound

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

We try'n to take it slow, but we still losin' control

Ya we try to make it work, but its still is the worst

And I'm craaazayyy, tryin' to be your laaaadayyy

I think I'm goin' craaaazay

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Girl our love is dyin

Why can't you stop tryin

I never been a quitah

But I do deserve betta

Believe me I will do bad

Let's forget the past

And let's start this new plan

Why? Cuz it's the same old routine

And then next week I hear them scream

Girl I know you're tired of the things they say

You're damn right

Cuz I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday

That was a different thing

No it ain't

That was a different thing

No it ain't

That was a different thing

It was the same damn thing

Same ass excuses

Boy you're usless

Whhoooaaaa

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, J

'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to The Gallow's Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Motherfuckers!
Running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not so easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there is never an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell God be with you
If there's a God then why has he let me die?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away

Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
Please don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth

So when you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion

Oh, hallowed be thy name
Oh, hallowed be thy
Name

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name

How it go, it's not a joke, there's gon' be a homicide
I'm a ride, I'm a rep me a nigga up in the box
And send 'em to his folks, his bloods, his kin
The drama it don't end, bust a gun
Bust a nigga's face open with the hand
Tell 'em go tell a friend, tell a cop, tell the FEDS

D-d-d dance to the groove
There is no there is no getting over you.
Baby it feels so right
To dance to the beat up night
The heat between you and I retreat to the morning light
We like to live like class
And pour them shots up in the glass
But there is no,there is no getting over you.
I'm a party, and party and party and party...

To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment
Would you capture it?
Or just let it slip, yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, times up, over, blaw!!

Snap, back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody better go capture this moment
And hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order, a normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows it's all over, these h**s is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter lonely roads

God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These h**s don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera is told it unfolds
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on

Da da dum, da dum da da da da

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothaf****n' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped, writin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5

And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these *** damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screamin' on and too much for me to wanna

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothaf****n' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot, so here I go it's my shot
Feet fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

You can do anything you set your mind to, man</td>

[Girls voice is Dina Rea]

[Intro]
Oooooh
You high baby
Yeah
Ya'
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something
Uh-huh
I know what you want to hear...

[Chorus A]
Cause, I know you want me baby, I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby", I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too
They call me superman, I'm here to rescue you
I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
"Ooooh boy you drive me crazy", bitch you make me hurl...

[Verse 1]
They call me superman, leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down, in a relationship
Save it bitch, babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase, I tell a muthafuckin' slut, to her face
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick, get my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out, won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit, wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice, buy you ice, bitch if you died, I wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be my new wife, what you Mariah, fly through twice...

[Prechorus]
But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo'
Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

[Chorus B]
Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman...

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong, I love these ho's
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what, that's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again, I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in, we'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I, I don't want to flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do, how could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you, we just met and I just fucked you...

[Prechorus]

[Chorus A / Chorus B]

[Verse 3]
First thing you say, "I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyways
You're just plain old Marshall to me"
Ooh ya' girl run that game
"Hailie Jade, I love that name, love that tatoo, what's that say"
"Rot in pieces, uh, that's great"
First off you don't know Marshall, at all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal, I'll slap you off that barstool
There goes another lawsuit, leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie, you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have, ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab, end up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a tampax, and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance, don't mean to ruin your plans...

[Prechorus]

Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. , I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song "" has gotten such rotten responses."

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on  (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am</td>

We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorce, throwin' her over furniture
It's the return of the, "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said, nothing you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!
Feminist women love Eminem
Chigga chigga chigga, "Slim shady, I'm sick of him

Look at him, walkin' around grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on T.V. and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss"
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is

Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the discovery channel don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals", well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records
Well I do, so f*ck him and f*ck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first

You little bitch, put me on blast on M.T.V
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"

I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a f*ck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with jergens
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a slim shady lurkin'
He could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a f*ck!"
With his windows down and his system up

So, will the real shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady
All you other slim shadys are just imitating
So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady

So won't The Real Slim Shady please stand up

'Coz I'm slim shady, yes I'm the real shady

Artist: Eminem
Album: Recovery
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife
In my windpipe
I can't breathe
But I still fight
While I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right
It's like I'm in flight
High of a love
Drunk from the hate
It's like I'm huffing paint
And I love it the more that I suffer
I sufficate
And right before im about to drown
She resuscitates me
She fucking hates me
And I love it
Wait
Where you going
I'm leaving you
No you ain't
Come back
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane
Cause when it's going good
It's going great
I'm Superman
With the wind in his bag
She's Lois Lane
But when it's bad
It's awful
I feel so ashamed
I snap
Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe
When you're with them
You meet
And neither one of you
Even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills
Used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick
Of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em
Never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom
And these words
When you spit 'em
You push
Pull each other's hair
Scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down
Pin 'em
So lost in the moments
When you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best
To go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
Cause today
That was yesterday
Yesterday is over
It's a different day
Sound like broken records
Playin' over
But you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things
Did things
That we didn't mean
And we fall back
Into the same patterns
Same routine
But your temper's just as bad
As mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love
You're just as blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you
Baby it was me
Maybe our relationship
Isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens
When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is
I love you too much
To walk away though
Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity
In my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed
I'll aim my fist
At the dry wall
Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize
Even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games
I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed
And set the house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Hi guys, this is Hellogoodbye...
You can run you can hide 
but you can't escape my love 
Here's how it goes 
You and me 
Up and down but maybe this time 
We'll get it right 
Worth a fight 
Cause love is something you can't shake 
When it breaks 
All it takes is some trying 

If you feel like leaving 
I'm not gonna make you stay 
But soon you will find that 
You can run you can hide 
but you can&#8217;t escape my love 
You should know 
It&#8217;s to hard 
It's to hard just to forget the past 
So fast 
In the end 
It was good but it was real but thats 
All it takes 
In the end, all that mattered 
If you feel like leaving 
I'm not gonna make you stay 
and soon you will find that 
You can run you can hide 
But you can&#8217;t escape my love 
But you can't escape my love 
Here's how it goes 
All it takes is some trying 
If you feel like leaving 
I'm not gonna make you stay 
But soon you will find that 
You can run you can hide 
but you can&#8217;t escape my love
You can run you can hide 
but you can&#8217;t escape my love
You can run... 
You can run...

Just like nothing happened last night

I don't think she's coming back for more, no, no

Now, I'm left up in my lonely room
She left her underwear and her perfume
I never thought that it could be this good
And I still feel her lips upon my fingertips
I'm trying hard not to feel rejected

Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise the glass
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

So will someone come and carry me home?

The waves are rising for this time of year

And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

I got a feeling now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul

I prayed on the immovable
Yeah, clinging to the atoms of rocks
Seasons, the adjustments, signs of change

It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Natures corrupted in factories far away

(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
Uh
(That's electric)
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
Uh

When the mako flies (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes (as it leaps from the stream)
Then I'll know the twilight skies (blood curdles, its death throe)

When you burned down the house and home?

Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

If I could escape
I would, but first of all let me say
I must apologize for acting, stinking, treating you
this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk fell on the
floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refridgerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape
And re-create a place as my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?

If I could be sweet
I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
so ever, we can make it better
Tell me boy, Now wouldn't that be sweet?
Sweet escape

(I wanna get away, to our sweet escape)

You let me down
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around let's look for some common
ground

So baby, times getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way the you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me
Want to take you with me

If I could escape
And re-create a place as my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?

I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

[Verse 3]
You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun

[Bridge]
Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory

You're wrong when it's right
You're black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We Kiss, we make up

You, you don't really wanna stay, no
But you, you don't really wanna go, oh

'Cause you're hot and you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down

We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot and you're cold
You're yes and you're no
You're in and you're out

You're up and you're down

You're wrong when it's right
You're black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We hug, we make up

You, you don't really wanna stay, no
But you, you don't really wanna go, oh

You're hot and you're cold
You're yes and you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot and you're cold
You're yes and you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down

You're wrong when it's right
You're black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We hug, we make up

You, you don't really wanna stay, no
But you, you don't really wanna go, oh

You're hot and you're cold
You're yes and you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down</td>

You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me, I was a wreck
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February you'll be my valentine, valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's runaway and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a floor out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue

Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well

It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure

Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
Ended kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny-dipping in the dark
Then had a m&#233;nage &#224; trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna sto-op
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees
(Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek
(At us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock
West-coast represent
Now put your hands up

Sex on the beach
We've got white sand in our stilettos
We freak in my jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock

West-coast represent
Now put your hands up

Toned, tanned, fit, and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild, wild west-coast
These are the girls I love the most

I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak, she drive a Jeep
And live on the Beach

I'm okay, I won't play, I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everyday

Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zuchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

Katy, my lady?
(Yeah?)
Looky here, baby
(Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause your represtin' California

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock
West-coast represent
Now put your hands up

California, California girls
(California girls, man)
California, California girls

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim

I'm staying up all night hoping

What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug

Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I gotta question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love with your drug? Your drug, your drug
Your drug, is my love your drug?

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Take me down to the river-bend. 
Take me down to the fighting end. 
Wash the poison from off my skin. 
Show me how to be whole again. 
Fly me up on a silver wing. 
Past the black where the sirens sing. 
Warm me up in a nova's glow. 
And drop me down to the dream below. 
Cause I'm only a crack in this Castle of Glass. 
Hardly anything there for you to see. 
For you to see. 

Bring me home in a blinding dream. 
Through the secrets that I have seen. 
Wash the sorrow from off my skin 
and show me how to be whole again. 
Cause I'm only a crack in this Castle of Glass. 
Hardly anything there for you to see. 
For you to see. 

Cause I'm only a crack in this Castle of Glass. 
Hardly anything else I need to be. 
Cause I'm only a crack in this Castle of Glass.

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Chorus

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me

Te dijo te amo

I prayed taht the days would last

They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky

When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by

Beautiful faces, no cares in this world

Where a girl loves a boy

And a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear, my dear

The 7 things I hate about you!
The 7 things I hate about you, oh you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy

Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent
As I wait for you to say
What I need to hear now
Your sincere apology

When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back

You're taking 7 steps here

The 7 things I hate about you!
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her

When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the 7 that I like

The 7 things I like about you!
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy

Your hands in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like most that you do
You make me love you, you do</td>

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on

lipped-mouths in the night
And stumbling through the street they say, Sir do you
got a light?
And if you do then you're my friend
And if you don't then you're my foe
And if you are a deity of any sort then please don't go

Ne Me Quitte Pas mon cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas ah ah ah
Ne Me Quitte Pas mon cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas

Down in Lexington they walk in new shoes stuck to aging
feet
And close their eyes and open
And not recognize the aging street
And think about when things were right
When they were young and veins were tight
And if you are the ghost of Christmas past
Then won't you stay the night

Ne Me Quitte Pas mon cher

Down in Bronxy Bronx the kids go sledding
Down snow covered slopes and frozen noses, frozen toes
And the frozen city starts to glow
And yes they know it will pass
And yes they know New York will thaw
But if you're a friend of any sort
Then play along and catch a cold

Ne Me Quitte Pas mon cher
Ne Me Quitte Pas ah ah ah

Down in Paris they walk fast
That is unless they're walking slow
And in cafes they look away
That is unless they look right in
And in the corners I'm getting lost
That is unless I'm getting found
And if you are the ghost of New York City
Then won't you stick around

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything's so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama? Bonita, mi casa, su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad

Come on let's go, real slow
Don't you see baby asi es perfecto

I know I'm on tonight my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right

Oh boy, I can see your body moving

Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan

My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de d&#195;&#173;a

Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi, say it!
Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi

Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates
For Humpty Humpty we need a whole club dizzy

Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
[Incomprehensible]
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie

Life is what happens while you?re busy making your excuses
Another day, another casualty but that won?t happen to me

Whoa! No, we?re not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa! And we won?t come back, the world is calling out
Whoa! Leave the past in the past, gonna find the future

And misery loves company, well so long
You?ll miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
When I?m gone, let?s go!

Won?t look back when I say goodbye
I?m gonna leave this hole behind me, gonna take what?s mine tonight
?Cause every wasted day becomes a wasted chance
You?re gonna wake up feeling sorry ?cause life won?t wait
I guess it?s up to you

Whoa! No, we?re not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoa! And we won?t come back, the world is calling out
Whoa! Leave the past in the past gonna find the future
And misery loves company, well so long
You?ll miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone</td>

Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the
past
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill
of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his
prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of
the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds, still we take to the
street
For the kill with the skill to survive

It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill
of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his
prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of
the tiger

Risin' up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill
of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his
prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of
the tiger

The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger</td>

I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost
If I'm asking for help, it's only because
Being with you has opened my eyes
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?
I keep asking myself, wondering how
I keep closing my eyes, but I can't block you out

And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
They say it's my fault, but I want her so much
Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
When they stop and stare, don't worry me
'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

And you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

And the flashback starts I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way
Through the crowd and say "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said

Romeo take me, somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, Baby just say "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

Uh-Oh, 'cause you were Romeo I was a Scarlet
Letter and my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go, and I said

Romeo take me, somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, Baby just say "Yes"

Romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, Baby just say "Yes"

Uh-Oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelts to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
It's a love story Baby just say, "Yes"

Uh-Uh-Oh, Uh-Uh-Oh

Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture

Fab Five Freddie told me everybody's fly
DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind
Flash is fast, flash is cool
Francois sais pas, flashe' no do

And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light

And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head

And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subarus

And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars

Where the people meet

Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars

He's eatin' bars, yeah, wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure

Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
I said, "Don't stop, do punk rock"

Man to man, body muscular
Seismic decibel by the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder, no sign of bad luck in rapture

Well, now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on

Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot

'Cause the man from Mars
Stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And now he only eats guitars
Get up!</td>

Oh man, im tired!
And a long yet productive day at the studio today
Feeling little good about myself
Just gonna check my facebook and see if I got any messages from old friends of mine
Maybe brag a little bit, Y'know what I mean?

[Verse 1:]
I just updated my status
It says, "Big Wax is the motherfuckin' baddest"
And along comes Katie, from Missouri
Hits the 'Like' button in a hurry
Two minutes later got a worry cause I check my messages
And my girl wants to know who this bitch I had sex with is
I say, "Who?". Up comes the chat box
"Katie." Caps Lock
I typed back, "Girl it ain't like that."
Katie is the girlfriend of my boy Mike that I know from a Psych Lab, he's a college buddy
She typed, "O-M-G. I'm not a dummy."
Her status says 'Single' on the wall
Is that the girl you fucked on tour last fall
So I hit the X, then I get a text, then I get a call
Then I get a tweet at @BigWax "Fuck Y'all"
I hope you and Katie both die
Here's an e-kite you should both go fly
I should've just deleted my page
Fuck that, now I'mma need it to get laid

[Hook:]
Don't be postin' nothin' up on my wall
Stay off my facebook
Stay offa my facebook
And don't be tagging me in nothin' at all
Stay off my facebook
Get up offa my facebook
And now my girlfriend wants to chop of my balls
Stay off my facebook
Stay offa my facebook
It just makes it oh so easy to stalk
Stay off my facebook
Bitch, get off my facebook

[Verse 2:]
Check it out
Yo, drunk pictures, fun at the show
Not cool to everyone that you know
I just had a job interview, it would've been a a great look
Interviewer called me and said he saw my Facebook
He said I ain't gettin' the position
Due to the picture of me nekkid in my kitchen
With a bong in my hand that I just got tagged in
All my friends makin' up their own fake captions
One read, "That's Mike to a T."
And that was the one that was typed by me
Whatever happened to privacy?
My mom got a page just to spy on me
When she first friended me, I fuckin' hated it
Cause she thinks everything's some drug-related shit
What are those little smiley faces for?
Damn It! I should've just hit ignore
Yeah, I'm about to bite the bullet
Delete my page, yeah, tonight I'm gonna do it
Make a fake page with a wrong name and just use it to stalk my ex and play that farm game

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Once and for all, I just want all you motherfuckers to stay off my facebook page
In fact, I'm gonna delete it and make a new one
I'll pick a name of somebody really cool
And have a picture with some dude with chiseled abs
Takin' a picture in front of the mirror
Say I'm from a cool place
Maybe, I'll be from, uh, Anchorage, Alaska, or some shit...</td>

She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: "Don't you ever show this!"
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said "Your words get me open"
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now lets pretend like it was all good (good)
like I didn't live staring in a notebook (notebook)
Like I did the things that
I probably knew I should (should)
But I aint have neighbours thats why they call it hood (hood yeah)
Now lets pretend like I aint got a name before they ever call me BOB aka Bobby ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes (yeah) before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before the ever once compared me to andre before I ever got on myspace
Before they ever noticed my face so lets just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes
[Chorus]
[Bridge II:]
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone (gone gone) and just memories
(oh oh)
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone (gone gone)
[Eminem]
Allright lets pretend Marshall Mathers
never picked up a pen
Lets pretend things would have been no different
Pretend he procrastinated had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin they could blow away with the wind
Marshall you're never gonna make it makes no sense to play the game there ain't no way that you'll win
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools were changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in a gymnasium bitch you won't amount to shit quit daydreaming kid
You need to get your cranium checked you thinking like an alien it just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it
And his alarm went off to wake him off but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics left to his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailey and Laney these food stamps and this *WIC* shit
Cuz he never risked shit he hopes and he wished it but it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here
He pretends that
[Hailey Williams]
Airplanes in the night sky like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
wish right now wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
in the night sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now
wish right now wish right now
Uh hmm oh oh oh ooo
Uhu mm aalalalaa

Hey brother, there's a better way out

Snorting that coke, shooting that dope man, you're copping out
Take my advice, it's either live or die
You've got to be strong, if you want to survive

The family on the other side of town
Would catch hell without a ghetto around

*Lyrics below the line
=====================================

Here I am
Lost in the light of the moon that comes thru my window
Bathed in blue
The walls of my memories divides the thorns from the roses
it's you and the roses

Touch me and I will follow
In your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go
I will find my way, when I see your eyes
Now I'm living
In your afterglow

Here I am
Lost in the ashes of time
But who wants tomorrow
In between
The longing to hold you again

I'm caught in your shadow
I'm losing control
My mind drifts away
We only have today

Touch me and I wil follow
In your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go
I will find my way, I will sacrifice
Til the blinding day, when I see your eyes
Now I'm Living
In Your Afterglow
(in your afterglow)

And the veils are gone
As I let you go
As I let you go

Touch me and I wil follow
In your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go
I will find my way, I will sacrifice
Now I'm living
In your afterglow

Bathed in blue
The walls of my memories divides the thorns from the roses
It's you who is closing</td>

Back door cracked
We don't need a key
We get in for free
No VIP sleaze

Drink that Kool-Aid
Follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're coming with me

It's time to kill the lights
And shut the DJ down
(This place about to)
Tonight we're taking over
No one's getting out

This place about to blow, blow
This place about to blow, blow
This place about to blow, blow
This place about to blow, blow
This place about to

Now what?
We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't

Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored

It's time to lose your mind
And let the crazy out
(This place about to)

Tonight we're taking names
'Cause we don't mess around

This place about to blow, blow
This place about to blow, blow
This place about to blow, blow
This place about to blow, blow
This place about to

Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them hands
Let me, let me see them hands

Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them hands
Let me, let me see them hands

We're taking over
(Blow)
Get use to it, okay
(Blow)

This place about to blow, blow
This place about to blow, blow
This place about to blow, blow
This place about to blow, blow

She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow I want more

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come anytime you want

I don't mind spending every day

Look for the girl with the broken smile

Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls,

And the time spent alone

But there is really nothing
Nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten
Life can always start off anew

The models will have children
We'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models
Everything must run its course

I only dream of you
And you never knew

Sing for absolution

In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die

Where were you when I was burned and broken
While the days slipped by from my window watching
Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted

Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life

I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight...into the shining sun</td>

Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
And now you're here and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why

And I don't know why

And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head they are dying

Of implication, insinuation and ill will
Till you cannot lie still
In all this turmoil
Before red cape and foil
Come closing in for a kill

Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust 
Yeah, feed the rain 
'Cause without your love my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust

It's all a game, avoiding failure
When true colors will bleed
All in the name of misbehavior
And the things we don't need
I lust for after no disaster can touch
Touch us anymore
And more than ever
I hope to never fall
Where enough is not the same it was before

Come feed the rain

Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain

Robin Thicke:
If you can&#8217;t hear what I&#8217;m trying to say
If you can&#8217;t read from the same page
Maybe I&#8217;m going death, maybe I&#8217;m going blind
Maybe I&#8217;m out of my mind

Pre-chorus:
Ok now he was close, tried to domesticate you
But you&#8217;re an animal, baby it&#8217;s in your nature
Just let me liberate you

You&#8217;re far from plastic
Talk about getting blasting
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it

But you&#8217;re a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

Verse 2: Robin Thicke
What do they make dreams on
When you got them jeans on
What do feelings &#8230; from
You the hottest b*tch in this place

Robin Thicke
I feel so lucky, you wanna hug me
Hey, hey, hey
What rhymes with hug me?
Hey, hey, hey

Pre-chorus:
Ok now he was close, tried to domesticate you

Verse 3: T.I.
One thing I ask you
Let me be there when you &#8230; that ass too
Yo, from Malibu, to Paribu
Yeah, had a big machine daddy
So hit me up when you pass through
I&#8217;ll give you something big enough to take your ass too
Swag on, when when you dress casual
I mean it&#8217;s not most unbearable
Then, honey you&#8217;re not there when I&#8217;m
With my foresight b*tch you pay me by
Nothing like your leg, I ain&#8217;t too square for you
I&#8217;ll smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I jail watch, hand wave for you to salute
But you didn&#8217;t pick
Not many women get a &#8230;
But I&#8217;m a nice guy, but you get it if you get with me

Robin Thicke:
Shake the vibe, get down, get up,
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
Watcha doing like word

Baby can you breathe? I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me Dakota to Dakata, uh huh
No more pretending,
Hey, hey, hey
Cause now you winning
Hey, hey, hey
Here&#8217;s our beginning

Chorus:
I always wanted a good girl,
I know you want it
I know you want it

Get relax with the song will trump us
Ain't in trouble but they love me and like just

I think it's fair to love me, though
I think it's fair to love me, baby
I think it's fair to love me
Just the way I am
Just the way I am

Make a woman so sick and then the underpants flick
The whole body dance
And make you sick to the ceiling
The body veiling
There's so much feeling
I ain't never been one to follow the rules
And I'm not starting
And I'm not starting now
I don't know if you want to know where I've been
Since last night
Since last night
Yeah

It's fair to love me
I think it's fair to love me, baby
It's fair to love me
Just the way I am
OW!

All I know is hustle
All I know is rubble
All I know is struggle
All I know is trouble
All I know is smuggle
All I know is double

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Ain&#8217;t nobody business but the town
All of the scales, it&#8217;s digital underground
(Step up, step, step, step up, step up)
So you know I get around
But I be right back like the cracks in the foundation
That&#8217;s why we like what&#8217;s cracking and what&#8217;s shaking (what's shakin')
Bay slang birthed from the earthquakin&#8217;
And we bend never break, fast everyday
Hungry tummy always coming for the biggest plate
And the shift right left like the wipers on the scraper
Though the rain gon' come why you hiding under paper
No seeds, rolling tree with a looseleaf garden
Call a spade a nigga but these niggas, they ain&#8217;t sharp enough
To break dirt, better know I&#8217;ve been about the soil
Cali been about the gold like Texas been about the oil
So slick when I slide through
Chick wanna ride too
Clique bonafide, homicide like the nine do
Mind been on &#8220;I do&#8221;
Married to the hustle on fire like Piru, no blood
Muscle on wide I&#8217;m middle of the block like &#8220;what?&#8221;
Same white tee, still don&#8217;t give a fuck
Same white teeth, same smile, still suck
Same white people sitting with the game, fucked up
Set my day one spitting with the flame untucked
This the bay, son you missin&#8217; what we saying, dumb luck

[Chorus: E-40 &amp; Moe Green]
Yo, uh
What you thought it was a game?
Dominoes and bones when it's money on the way
Break a couple for you when you run into the gang
Don't be acting brand new if you really wanna play
Bitch, welcome to the Bay

[Verse 2: Rafael Casal]
I don't got too many friends now
Many robbed me of my intiution so I axed 'em
Playin' my position I got 20/20 vision
I don't listen if the pimpin' isn't part of how you flex 'em
Got me feelin' extra, bless up, 3-deep the car
Mobbin about the monty what I'm dropping is CPR
To push down on a couple bodies
Who clowned and be speaking harder
It seemed she wasn't around till I freed up a couple yards
Oh, you thought that was easy
Lot of fakers caught the tape and now repeat me
I was in a scraper pulling favors for the capers
Putting casual commissary for my motherfuckers
Caught up in the danger at the precinct
Me thinks we should body this new flock of too cocky
Bourgeoisie bitch looking hipster kids passing this rap shit
It seemed far too popular
Putting a couple shots in they monikers
Thinking they Gods when they not even common carpenters
Hollerin' hollow as top notch telemarketers
Who got some top like you talkin tall as a tightrope
But in a crap game
He don't know how to dice though

[Chorus: E-40 &amp; Moe Green]
Yo, uh
What you thought it was a game?
Dominoes and bones when it's money on the way
Break a couple for you when you run into the gang
Don't be acting brand new if you really wanna play
Bitch welcome to the Bay

[Bridge: Daveed Diggs &amp; E-40]
Hold up, write that down (All I know is hustle)
One time let me see (All I know is Bubba)
Tough stuff, great stuff (All I know is struggle)
Shake it
Break that shit down (All I know is trouble)
One time let me see (All I know is smuggle)
Tough stuff, great stuff (All I know is double)
Shake it

[Verse 3: E-40]
When I'm in first class on a plane people ask me what I do for a living
I tell em, a little bit of this, a little bit of that, hustlin' and grittin'
Getting my money up, pockets need a tummy tuck
My wallet and my bankroll and my baller gut
When I was young I had a discussion with my street side
What did you talk about?
Living and dying
What about your paper route?
Rhytmic grindin'
Clientele and clout?
Multiplyin'
Now I came in the gang with a boomerang
Never sold pews, but they used to sell that there candy cane
Evils and heels living 500, he all right
In the hood was black folks think that castor oil cure everything
All kind of different treats with all kind of different names
I use ocean soil and chicken shit to feed my strains
The Hillside of Vallejo was the land I claim
I gave my brother Dannell some meal to buy a Mustang
Back in 1985 when shit was live
We did what we had to do to survive
All the real ones gone in jail or even died
So it's up to me to teach 'em the ghetto guides

From the LBC shore, wheels up on the G4
Louis bag with the Gucci loafs, silk shirt with a mink coat
Flying in, selling game to all you hoes and you're buying in
Legend in your presence, hiding
Got a room full of bitches and they lying there
High in there, ain't no fire, but a lot of wine in there
They get it, ain't no WiFi
On the low, close the door, bitch, I Spy
See when I pull up, jump in, we slip out
Roll up, roll out, get mines, dip out
She had to come and give a real Crip a taste
Out of pocket, never that stayin' in stripper's place
Big brown ass with some fat titties
And baby make magic when I'm in the city

When you're together you wanna be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss

I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead," Yeah

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"

Never mind I'll find someone like you

Guided by a beating heart

But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

lrc by the evil diva

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
I'll tell you that.
But if I didn't say it,
well I'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and
destruction to come back again
And I caused but nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
then I'm sure that that makes sense

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was then
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....
Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Title: Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)

They heard me singing and they told me to stop,
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock,
These days, my life, I feel it has no purpose,
But late at night the feelings swim to the surface.
Cause on the suburbs the city lights shine,
They're calling at me, come and find your kind.

Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small,
Then we can never get away from the sprawl,
Living in the sprawl,
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains,
And there's no end in sight,
I need the darkness someone please cut the lights.

We rode our bikes to the nearest park,
Sat under the swings, we kissed in the dark,
We shield our eyes from the police lights,
We run away, but we don't know why,
And like a mirror these city lights shine,
They're screaming at us, we don't need your kind.

Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small,
Then we can never get away from the sprawl,
Living in the sprawl,
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains,
And there's no end in sight,
I need the darkness someone please cut the lights.

They heard me singing and they told me to stop,
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock.

Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small,
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?
Living in the sprawl,
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains,
And there's no end in sight,
I need the darkness someone please cut the lights.

It was twenty years ago today
When Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, &amp; Ringo Starr]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, &amp; George Harrison]
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Segue: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison &amp; Ringo Starr]
Billy Shears!

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney &amp; George Harrison]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney]
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney &amp; George Harrison]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney &amp; George Harrison]
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney &amp; George Harrison]
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said:
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown

Sometimes I get this feeling, makes me hesitate

I believe
She won't take me somewhere I'm not supposed to be
You can't steal the things that God has given me
No more pain and no more shame and misery

You can't take me down
You can't break me down
You can't take me down

You can't break me down
You can't take me down
You can't break me down

I can see that place of trouble
And I'm on the verge
For the love of everybody
I need something more

And now I feel some days of trouble
In the house full
For the love of everybody
Look behind the wall

Standing now
Calling all the people here to see the show
Calling all my demons now to let me go
I need something, give me something wonderful</td>

Yo, it's a beautiful day, and everybody's feelin' wonderful
The ladies is out, lookin' fly, dressed comfortable
I love to wake up, and feel the breeze through my window
Slip on a fatigues, grab a dutch and roll some indo
It be days like these, that make life so much easier
Fish thawin' out, Guinness Stout in the freezer
Walk the block at my leisure (my leisure)
Summertime is like a anesthesia
So many pretty things to please ya
The greenery
Beautiful birds, natural scenery
Or even just a infinite sky
We be forever puffin' lah
On the block, or tellin' jokes in the ride (ha ha ha)
When the weather be hot, everybody be outside (whut)
Havin' fun (aight?), eatin' fresh fruits and vegetables
And good food put me in the mood for a festival
Some say the summer make a woman more sexual (s'up, boo)
It's instinct -- that's why my game be right on schedule
I put the great Mother Nature on a pedestal
She always fly, but today, she's exceptional
If I had a chance to make a wish
Every day would be just like this, full of Happiness

I feel great
Even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin'
Feelin' fine
Leavin' my bad times behind

Feels great
And no, we can't escape from the realness
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be alive
Feelin' fine
Livin' life one day at a time
Feelin' great

Yeah, knaw'msayin'?
I just wanna give a shout out
To everybody who got a birthday today
Happiness (Happiness)

Have you ever heard the children play?
Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a j, and get away
Put some food on the grill
And just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
'Cause it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune, 'cause it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh), a day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out, all night to sunrise
Celebration of life, 'cause every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to (uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind (whut)
You can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind</td>

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And Mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover

Call me, call me
Won`t you call this number now?

Mesmerised
I go back to where we met

A reconstruction of the crime
I can`t track you down
nowhere to be found
Now my one shot at success
is the power of the press
Won`t you

Worlds apart
we are worlds apart

Watch this space

No need to read between the lines
I am inside out
there can be no doubt
I want you and no one else
please identify yourself

And one day I'll be dead yo yo</td>

He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"

Growing up in the ghetto
Hanging out on corners
Singin' with the fellas
Lookin' for the Gypsy
Trying to find a bit of fun
Looking for some trouble
Or anyone who'll give me some

I was young and crazy
In the ghetto
Didn't know what my life would be
In the ghetto
I was dumb and oh so lazy
In the ghetto
Something had a spell on me
In the ghetto

You wanna know what I'm talkin' bout?
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life
Ghetto Liiiiiiiiiiiife
You wanna know what I'm singin' 'bout?
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life
Ghetto Liiiiiiiiiiiife

When I was a young man
Kind of free and fancy
Met this little cute girl
She said her name was Nancy
She had pigtails to her shoulders
She couldn't have been much older
She taught me what I had to know
To make a girl not want to go

She was very kinky
In the ghetto
She laid her pigtails down on me
In the ghetto
And I was feeling oh so sneaky
In the ghetto
I had to see what love could be
In the ghetto

I knew it all along
That my game was strong
But I was wrong that time
I knew I had to pray
And give myself away
Did you think I was man enough?
Yeah
Did you think I was smart enough?
Yeah
Did you think I was strong enough?
Yeah
Did you think I'd work it out?

The Ghetto Life

Sing it to ya, hit it baby baby
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life
You got to get on over
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life

When I was a young boy
Tenements, slums and corner bums
Playing tag with winos
The only way to have some fun
One thing 'bout the ghetto
You don't have to hurry
It'll be there tomorrow
So brother don't you worry

Ghetto Life
Talking 'bout ghetto life
Talking 'bout Ghettoo Liiiiiiiiife
Ghetto Life, baby
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life

Life

Life
(Talkin' 'bout ghetto life)
Shoop Shoop Shoop Shoop, Shoop be doop in the ghetto
People we got to get over

Where's the place we funk?
Ghetto Land that's the place we funk
The place we like to funk
Ghetto Land that's the place where we funk
Say where the place we funk

Flash, we meet
Passin' in the streets
Words unspoken
Silence unbroken, hey

We fell into romance
The cry of success
Left no room to guess

I knew that this was it
So much emotion
Made so much devotion

And when we talk
We're never miles apart
Your telephone line
Is tied right to my heart

(Love me, baby)
Your love has knocked me down and scored
(Knock me out, baby)
You may hide and close your door
(Baby, baby)
Open up, I swear it's true

Made it somethin' so great

Lieutenant detective Christian F. "Bigfoot" Bjornsen
[?]
John Wayne walk, a flattop of Flintstone proportions and a shit evil twinkle in his eye that says 'civil rights violation'

At Playa Vista High, Shasta made Class Beauty in the yearbook four years running, always got to be the ingenue in school plays, fantasized like everybody else about getting into the movies, and soon as she could manage it was off up the freeway looking for some low-rent living space in Hollywood. Doc, aside from being just the only doper she knew who didn't use heroin, which freed up a lot of time for both of them, had never figured out what else she might've seen in him. Not that they were even together that long. Soon enough she was answering casting calls and getting some theater work, onstage and off, and they each gradually located a different karmic thermal above the megapolis, gliding each into a different fate

Back when they were together, she could go weeks without anything more complicated than a pout
Now she was laying some heavy combination of face ingredients on Doc that he couldn't really read at all

Does it ever end?

Of course it does

It did</td>

Young man, there's no need to feel down, I said
Young man, pick yourself off the ground, I said
Young man, 'cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy
Young man, there's a place you can go, I said
Young man, when you're short on your dough you can
Stay there and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A. 
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

Young man, are you listening to me? I said
Young man, what do you want to be? I said
Young man, you can make real your dreams
But you've got to know this one thing
No man does it all by himself, I said
Young man, put your pride on the shelf
And just go there, to the Y.M.C.A. 
I'm sure they can help you today

Young man, I was once in your shoes, I said
I was down and out with the blues, I felt
No man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so jive
That's when someone came up to me and said
"Young man, take a walk up the street
It's a place there called the Y.M.C.A. 
They can start you back on your way"

Got something to say on a rainy day
My 9-5 can't take my soul
I'm too awake I'm too alive
Not satisfied with a world of lies
Lay down in a grave go back to sleep
Or so they'd wish for you to go away
Your one true face could shine so bright

It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend</td>

I was just coastin'
Never really goin anywhere
Caught up in a web I was gettin kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue
I fell for you

[Chorus]
Now you're lifting me up, instead of holding me down
Stealing my heart instead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

[Verse 2]
Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt till you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

[Chorus]
Now you're lifting me up instead of holding me down

Stealing my heart instead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Now you're lifting me up instead of holding me down
You're taking my hand instead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied

[Chorus]
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies

You got me smiling with tears in my eyes

No, I've never been this far off of the ground

But I don't wanna come down

You can have your space, cowboy

Go on ride away, in your Silverado

After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
There ain't room for both of us in this town

Taking me apart at my friend's house
I was uncomfortable, I was hurt
Still with blue innocence in his eyes
I felt my reasoning was harsh

With every stab wound and exhale, I promised myself
That I would never lose my youthful fears of grown up men
I'm scarred with cruel intentions
I thought of another the whole time
Who would have never stared me like that
See, he saw me as a human
This one thinks I'm a slaughterhouse

He pretends that he's understanding
And you know in the grand scheme of everything
He's probably called a nice man
Or an ordinary kind of man
Or a stereotype with strong hands, I'm so sad
At how little joy I realized within my time with my ex guy
Before these statues arrived

Romance is dead and done
And it hits between the eyes on this side
The grass is dead and barren
And it hurts between my thighs on this side

I could begin to open up and risk desire
For I move slower and quieter than most
I grew up too quick and I still forgive too slow
Oh, I wish there was another way

Named every star
Shed every bruise and

Sat on a roof
Your hand in mine, singing
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"
And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and all its weight"
Here I just wanna say

Amazing day

Sat on a roof
Named every star and
Showed me a place
Where you can be who you are

And the view

The whole Milky Way
In your eyes
I'm drifting away
And in your arms
I just wanna sway

Amazing day

And I asked every book
Poetry and chime
"Can there be breaks
In the chaos of times?"

Because now I always
Want to feel this way

Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain

Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up

I'm awfully underrated, but came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma state it for the record
I am the opposite of whack; opposite of weak
Opposite of slack; synonym of heat; synonym of crack 
Closest to a peak, far from a punk
Y'all ought to stop talking, start trying to catch up, motherfucker

And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker

Oh, when they come for me
Come for me, I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me, I'll be gone
Oh, when they come for me
Come for me, I'll be gone

And all the people say
Try to catch up motherfucker

With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there,
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we dead it, Forget it,
Let it all disappear.

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control....

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go...

(Oh!) I know what it takes to move on,
I know how it feels to lie,
All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last,
I wish it wasn't so...
(Oh!) I know what it takes to move on,
I know how it feels to lie,
All I wanna do

Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And i don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin?
The hardest part of ending Is starting again!!

All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what i haven't got...

This is not the end
This is not the beginning,
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violet rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em
(Holding on to what i haven't got)

We say Yeah!
With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there,
'Cause we're living at the mercy of

And I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest

What if I'd been born fifty years before you
In a house on the street where you live?
Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike
Would I know?

And in a wide sea of eyes

I see one pair that I recognize
And I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest

I love you more than I have
Ever found a way to say to you

Next door, there's an old man who lived to his 90's
And one day, passed away in his sleep
And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way
To tell you that I know we belong
That I know that I am

I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost
If I'm asking for help, it's only because
Being with you has opened my eyes
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?
I keep asking myself, wondering how
I keep closing my eyes, but I can't block you out

They say it's my fault, but I want her so much
Wanna fly her away where the sun and rain
Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
When they stop and stare, don't worry me
'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me

But it's driving me mad, going out of my head

Only know you've been high when

Only hate the road when you're

Only know your lover when you let

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream
last
But dreams come slow and they go so
fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch, surely dies

But you only need the light when it's

Only miss the sun when it starts to

Only know your lover when you let

Only know you've been high when

Only hate the road when you're

Only know you love her when you let
her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so
fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you

dive too deep

Well you only need the light when
it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to
snow
Only know you love her when you let
her go
Only know you've been high when
you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're

Only know your lover when you let
her go

Oh oh oh no
And you let her go
Oh oh oh no
Well you let her go

On the midnight train to Romford

Sweet in winter, sweet in rain

"Call me wet trampoline," she said today
But I was too busy with my hand
"Shake well before use," she said
But you never touch me anymore
I was busy listening for phone sex
Coming through the back door in skin tight trunks
And we all went mental and danced

I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six

To the off peak electricity
And the light blinds my eyes and I feel dirty
And the light blinds my eyes and I feel so shaken in my faith
Here comes Christ on crutches

And here comes another God, here comes another God
Like a buffalo thunder, with a smell of sugar
And a velvet tongue and designer voodoo
But I got phone sex to see me through the emptiness in my 501s
Freeze dried with a new religion
And my teeth step back in my head

I get my kicks on channel six
The light, it burns my eyes and I feel so dirty
Here comes Christ on crutches

I will not be confused
Will not be confused
You left me confused
I will not be confused with another man
This pressure of opinions

"Lighten up, listen to your eyes," you said
But all I could see was Doris Day in a big screen satellite
Disappearing down the tube hole on Farringdon Street
With whiplash Willy, the motor psycho

And the light, it burns my eyes
And the light, it burns my eyes
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six

Open up wide

Is made up on your side

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too

When you're gone
All the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay, I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you

And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take

Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
And when you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too

And when you're gone
All the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay, I miss you

We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, yeah-yeah

And all I ever wanted was for you to know!
Everything I do I'd give my heart and soul!
I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me! Yeah-eh!

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
And when you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too

And when you're gone
All the words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay, I miss you, mmm</td>

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you

They got one eye watching you, one eye on what you do
So be careful cause nothing they say is true
No d-don't believe a word, it's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you
You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting while my left hides under the chairs

Ah
Ah

Got one eye on the road and one on you
Got one eye on the road and one on you</td>

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

Birds came flying from the underground

Ideas that you'll never find
Or the inventors could never design

The buildings that you put up
Or Japan and China, all lit up

The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

Where's the street-wise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night toss and turn and dream of what I need

[Chorus]
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
He's gotta be sure
And it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life

Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach
There's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet

[Chorus]

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I would swear that there's someone somewhere
Watching me

Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach
Like the fire in my blood

You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna think anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna talk anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Call when you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
'Cause I'll be dancing, 'cause I'll be dancing
Tonight I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing

Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna think anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna talk anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop calling, stop calling

I got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling

I got my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

So I came into you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast 

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me, a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Stay away
Look out

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman

How completely wrong you can be
How completely wrong you can be

The sun is out, it melts the snow that fell yesterday
Makes you wonder why it bothered

I fell in love with the first cute girl that I met
Who could appreciate Georges Bataille
Standing at a Swedish festival
Discussing Story of the Eye
Discussing Story of the Eye

It's so embarrassing to need someone like I do you
How can I explain?
I need you here and not here too
How can I explain?
I need you here and not here too

I'm flunking out, I'm flunking out
I'm gone, I'm just gone
But at least I author my own disaster
At least I author my own disaster

Performance breakdown and I don't want to hear it
I'm just not available
Things could be different, but they're not
Oh, oh, things could be different, but they're not

The mousy girl screams, "Violence, violence!"
The mousy girl screams, "Violence, violence!"
She gets hysterical
'Cause they're both so mean
And it's my favorite scene

But the cruelty's so predictable
It makes you sad on the stage
Though our love project has so much potential
But it's like we weren't made for this world
Though I wouldn't really wanna meet someone who was

Do I have to scream in your face?
I've been dodging lamps and vegetables
Throw it all in my face
I don't care

Let's just have some fun
Let's tear this shit apart
Let's tear the fucking house apart
Let's tear our fucking bodies apart
Let's just have some fun

Somehow, you've red-rovered the Gestapo circling my heart
And nothing can defeat you -- no death, no ugly world
You've lived so brightly -- you've altered everything
I find myself searching for old selves
While speeding forward through the plate glass of maturing cells

I've played the unraveler, the parhelion
But even Apocalypse is fleeting
There's no death, no ugly world
Sometimes, I wonder if you're mythologizing me like I do you
Mythologizing me like I do you

We want our film to be beautiful, not realistic
Perceive me in the radiance of terror dreams
You can betray me
You can...
You can betray me

Teach me something wonderful
Crown my head, crowd my head with your lilting effects
Project your fears onto me
I need to view them
See there's nothing to them
I promise you, there's nothing to them

I'm so touched by your goodness
You make me feel so criminal
How do you keep it together?
I'm all, all unraveled

But you know no matter where we are
We're always touching by underground wires

I've explored you with the detachment of an analyst
But most nights, we've raided the same kingdoms
And none of our secrets are physical
None of our secrets are physical
None of our secrets are physical now</td>

Got her them paper stacks
Tatto above her crack

I had to handle that.
I was on it, sexy woman, let me shonin'

They be want it two in the mornin'
I'm zonin in them rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shorty did that pop &amp; lock
Had to break her off that gwap
Gah it was fly just like my glock.
Apple Bottom Jeans
Boots with the fur
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the Floor
Next thing you know
Shawty got Low Low Low Low Low Low Low Low.
Them baggy sweat pants
&amp; the Reeboks with the straps
She turned around &amp; gave that big booty a slap
She hit the Floor
Next thing you know
Shawty got Low Low Low Low Low Low Low Low.

Now don't you wanna tape
A booty shakin' on your tape?
So show it to your boys and
See the look on all they face

I move it to the left
Move it to the right
Double time, double time, all right
Show 'em what they like

Look at it, look at it
Slow motion, freeze
Stop for the camera
Paparazzi wanna see
Cheese

Hello, hey how you doin'?
I shake it like this
Now let me see if you can do it

Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop it on the one
Shake, shake, shake, shake
They faces all stunned

If you got it, got it, got it
Then move if kinda fast
If the boys all dance
While they tryna make a pass

Whistle while you work
Go 'head do your dirt
Even if you like to flirt

Lift up your skirts
Then turn 'em out
One leg girl
Go 'head shake it out

Do milkshake go with that shake?

Put your hands on your hips
Then you make a stank face
Then go on and let it whip

Whip it like moms
Witcha witcha back then
Then catch your breaf and then start it up again

One minute, two minute, three minute stop
Erybody drop like their have from the cops
Ayyo, there will be no fights
Though got a club, we ain't turnin' on the lights

Sally got a big old donkey

Let you see the booty shake

See I was sitting in the lounge
With my tight skirt on
And like a 3-D movie
He was watchin' the thong

All up in my grill
So he asked could he tag it
Two-timing from an ish like maggots

He tryin' to spit the game
What he had to say
Has anybody ever told you you look like Beyonce?

OK lil' boy want to boost my esteem
I said you need a rehab
'Cause you look like a fiend

Don't want to start a scene
I ain't tryin' to be mean
And even if you spend your green
You ain't get in between

'Cause this here queen
Keep on looking for clean
And like a diamond ring bling
See who wants get the wet dream

I see you got low
And you got plenty more to show, go
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom

You stand by, while he lies- then turn right round and forgive

Will part the colors of my sea, perfect color me

I didn't have much to say, I didn't give up the light
I closed my eyes and closed myself and closed my world and never opened
Up to anything that could get me along

I had to close down everything, I had to close down my mind
Too many things that caught me, too much can make you blind
I've seen so much in so many places, so many heartaches, so many faces
So many dirty things, you couldn't even believe

Now some of you, might still be in that place

To take a stand (to take a stand)

Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together,
through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like 
you've been down the same road 
(same road)

You could try and read my lyrics 
off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out 
these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma 
let you stop me from causin mayhem
When I say 'em or do somethin I do it,
I don't give a damn what you think,
I'm doin this for me, 
so f-ck the world Feed it beans,
it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin me
I'ma be what I set out to be, 
without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me 
I'm tearin down your balcony
No if ands or buts, 
don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" 
album he's still shittin,
whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits 
his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, 
like a f-ck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, 
forget the Earth, he's got the urge
to pull his dick from the dirt, 
and f-ck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together,

Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like 
you've been down the same road 
(same road)

Okay quit playin with the scissors and shit,
and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words 
in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, 
you lied through your teeth, 
for that F-ck your feelings, 
instead of gettin crowned you're gettin capped
And to the fans,
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, 
in fact Let's be honest, that last 
"Relapse" CD was ehhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin back to that now
All I'm tryin to say is get back, 
click-clack, blaow
Cause I ain't playin around
It's a game called circle 
and I don't know how,
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out 
but I guess I didn't, 
this f-ckin black cloud still follows,
me around but it's time to exorcise 
these demons These muh'f-ckers 
are doin jumpin jacks now!

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, 
through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like
you've been down the same road 
(same road)

And I just can't keep living this way
Sooo starting today, 
I'm breaking out of this caaaaage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life
back together right now! (now)

It was my decision to get clean, 
I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it 
subliminally for you,

so I could come back a brand new me
you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did,
believe me you
I been through the ringer, 
but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, 
I feel like the king of
my world, haters can make like bees 
with no stingers and drop dead, 
no more beef lingers 
No more drama from now 
on, I promise to focus solely on handlin
my responsibilities as
a father So I solemnly 
swear to always treat this roof, 
like my daughters and raise it, 
you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
Cause the way I feel,
I'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub, 
and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
I'll shoot for the moon 
but I'm too busy gazin at stars
I feel amazing and I'm

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together,
through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm

f*ckin' great, man
Okay, let me see, how could I begin?

Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Cap'n Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up and in between snack crackers to munch

Mariah, whatever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up? All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's goin' through you mind
After such a nasty break up

With that Latin hunk Luis Miguel
Nick Cannon better back the f*ck up
I'm not playin', I want her back you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk

Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zap and Eric Clapton shaft brings Abba crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want

I mean I really want ya bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease for Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's goin' through my mind half the time
When my rhyme are blowin' up my

Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the 'Vacancy' sign on 'cause I'm gone blowin' up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a mad man holdin' a glad

You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whip, a trickster
My signature sound when the tube of lipsticks surround
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow, man

What an ensemble, what an assortment of pharmaceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama

I cut you like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the f*ckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowin' ya Norman
You're so f*ckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy

You don't know what the f*ck you're doin'

I ain't playin' no f*ckin' more
Nick Cannon you prick, I wish you luck with the f*ckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucka born
Snuck up on Malakai and made the motherf*ckers suck
On a shucka corn

Shucka, shucka corn, shucka corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's f*ckin' on
Now what the f*ck are ya doin'? You're runnin' over the snow blower
With the lawnmower blowing your bagpipes from Baghdad

In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothin' will stop me from molestin' you
Titty f*ckin' you 'till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles

Is what they said, to the two conjoined twins
"How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?"
You need some ointment, just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip

I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get goin', how bad does the goin' get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin' groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip

I'm goin' to get the needle and thread from the sowin' kit
And attempt to separate 'em, and stitch them back at the loins, shit
Knew the little boy with the chocolate chips, ahoy chip
Cookie looky, even took me a Polaroid

I said, I smell something in the air that's makin' me high

Okay, here we go, do re mi fa so, fa so la ti da so
Lyrical Rosco, kick back the Tabasco
You motherf*ckers must just not know the tic-tock so
Time to show you the most kick ass flow in the cosmos

Picasso with a pick ax, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe frozen six pack, with exacto
Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, zig zags, I'm with the Doc, so

You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home, my novato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho

So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected nor what you thought so
About time that you wake the f*ck up, smell the pot smoke

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me, I don't mind

I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind

Your dreams are getting' fulfilled, ooh, I'm literally getting' the chills
Spittin' at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real

Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Llama
And be calm or bring drama a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please, don't upset me, mama, you lookin' sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama

Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra toppin' the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row?

Put 'em in chronological order, beginning with Jack the Ripper

Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate

And which model, which lake they found her in and how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun?
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the f*ckin' night's just begun

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

I said its the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

When I'm behind a mic, dynamite is what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryin' to light
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?

Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a Lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome

The spinning drama when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Starting from scratch and then endin' up at the end enough
Capable of bringin' a Pulitzer, strong believe a bullet's a
Titanium, cranium that's full of surprises

When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos high
Good evenin', this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

It must be the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the Hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

I said it's the ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' up on me while I'm so high

I've been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so f*cking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump

I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
And in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when
I ended up this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel dissin' again
So I decided just to pick this pen

Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I can't just sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow

One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others' eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get f*cked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get f*cked, just stay true to you

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check
The temperature of the room

Just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
And so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens the door
For conversation, like I want that

I'm not looking for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom

I don't need no f*cking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like

Ha! Marshall you're so funny man
You should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown

So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get f*cked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get f*cked, just stay true to you

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help

Now I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
I sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did

I just wanted to fit in
Every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid

And Edna always told me
Keep making that face and it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue tryna talk like that

'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
At 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
'Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it, from where you're sittin
It's probably 110% different

I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like

To feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get f*cked just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get f*cked just stay true to you

So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get f*cked just stay true to you
So

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has their private world
Where they can be alone

Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies
Stay strong, daddy will be home soon

And to the rest of the world
God gave you shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let anyone tell you you ain't beautiful</td>

In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes
400 assaults, and 4 murders, the undisputed, most diabolical
Villain in the world, Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ok, let's go
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I'm laying the cut
Missed the cut, the lady give a eighty some paper cut

Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance and hit the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio is back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me

But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again

I'll be dammed, just f*cked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
Its what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajauan do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a f*ck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf*cker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the f*ck I want, so what I trick?
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Cho shoes I say move a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Yes there gotta be there gotta be a better way

When the morning comes and the nighttime goes away (all day)
Don't you ever think that we won't be okay (no way)

Touching and rubbing and kissing and hugging you
What's this feeling taking over me

Pick up the pace and it aint no dropping it
Always forever I'll be by your side

I'm in love with you and you in love with me

If this goes our way my love will always be (eternally)
You have set my mind my love my heart so free
Together forever however just you and me

When she walks she's like a samba that
Swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes, each one she passes goes "ah!"

How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he

Cast away back for the better days,
When I knew it was easy to lie,
When I'd only one hand for goodbyes, then.

I slipped under the empty bed,
Got lost inside the dark hollows.
It's the black of your lenses I still can't see through.
And if you had been looking at me,
Then you'd know I'd intended to leave, here.

I don't get to make you nervous. But I got to, tonight.
I don't mean to make you nervous, I'm gonna have to, this time. 

I've gotta know we're better here than we were last year.

I can never just say what I mean,
Can only manage to say something similar.
If my tongue wasn't moored to the bow of my lips
Then I'd surely be able to say,
That our black and white has become grey. 

I don't get to make you nervous. But I got to, tonight.
I don't mean to make you nervous, I'm gonna have to, this time.</td>

A steep mountain to climb.
You would see.

I left my shoes under your bed
but I left my body outside.
How could I get back into this mess?
I kept telling myself the temptations would do me in.

From my lonely point of view
See every time that I'm with you
I think this will happen again.</td>

In her fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watchin' her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride break it down-down-down
You know I like when you hike and you throw it all around
Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I do to you

From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance, they ain't got
a chance
I need a gun 'cos all I do is dance
'Cos all I do is dance

I need a gun to keep myself among
The poor people are burning in the sun
No, they ain't got a chance, they ain't got
a chance
I need a gun 'cos all I do is dance
'Cos all I do is dance

In my backpack, I got my act right
In case you act quite difficult
And your is so weaken with anger and
discontent
Some are seeking and searching like me, moi

I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for
retaliation
I change the whole occasion to a pine box
six-under
Impulsive, don't ask wild wonder
Orders given to me is 'Strike' and I'm
thunder

With lightning fast reflexes on constant

alert
From the constant hurt that seems limitless
With no dropping pressure
Seems like everybody's out to test ya
'Til they see your brake

They can't conceal the hate that consumes
you
I'm the reason why you flipped your soosa
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days digit and I'm filled with
guilt
From things that I've seen

Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a
canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a
light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
The war is over, so said the speaker

With the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I wanna do is dance

Dance, dance, dance
I need a gun to keep myself among</td>

DO YOU KNOW
Do you know
Do you know,
Do you know, Do you know
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that&#8217;s in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.
If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year.
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can&#8217;t get it to speak
Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I&#8217;m standing on the edge and I don&#8217;t know what else to give.
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that&#8217;s in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.
How can I love you How can I love you How can I love you . . . .
If you just don&#8217;t talk to me, babe.
I flow through my act
The question is she needed
And decide all the man I can ever be.
Looking at the last 3 years like I did,
I could never see us ending like this.
Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that&#8217;s never happened to me.
But after this episode I don&#8217;t see, you could never tell the next thing life could be
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that&#8217;s in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that&#8217;s in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.
Do you know,
Do you know, Do you know . . . .</td>

Lyrics By : Manav (Yuvraj)

you 
do you remember me? 
like, i remember you?
do you spend your life, going back in your mind to that time? 
cause i
i walk the streets alone
i hate being on my own. 
and everyone can see that, i really fell,
and i'm going through hell.
thinking about you with somebody else.
somebody wants you, 
somebody needs you. 
somebody dreams about you every single night. 
somebody cant breathe, 
without you its lonely.
somebody hopes that some day you will see, 
that somebody's me.
that somebody's me.
yeaa...
how, 
how did we go wrong? 
it was so good, and now its gone.
and i pray at night, that our passing will cross. 
what we hide, isn't lost.
cause you are always driving in my thoughts..
somebody wants you, 
somebody needs you.
somebody dreams about you every single night.
somebody can't breathe, 
without you it's lonely.
somebody hopes that some day you'll see, 
that somebody's me. 
oh yeah.
you will always be in my life, 
even if i'm not in your life.
cause you're in my memory.
you, 
when you remember me?
..and before you set me free, 
oh listen please...
somebody wants you, 
somebody needs you.
somebody dreams about you every single night. 
somebody can't breathe, 
without you it's lonely.
somebody hopes that someday you will see, 
that somebody's me. 
that somebody's me. 
that somebody's me.
that somebody's me. 
oh yea..</td>

Lyrics By : Manav (Yuvraj)

I don't know why
You want to follow me tonight
When the rest of the world
With whom I've crossed and I've quarreled
Let's me down so
For a thousand reasons that I know
To share forever the unrest
With all the demons I possess
Beneath the silver moon
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
Eighth and Ocean Drive
With all the vampires and their brides
We're all bloodless and blind
And longing for a life
Beyond the silver moon
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon
So far away &#8211; so outer space
I've trashed myself &#8211; I've lost my way
I've got to get to you
I've got to get to you
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me

You know
I got this feeling
that I just can&#8217;t hide
I try to tell you how I feel
I try to tell you but I&#8217;m weak
Words don&#8217;t come easily
When you get close I shiver
I watch you when you smile
I watch you when you cry
And I still don&#8217;t understand
I can&#8217;t find the way to tell you
I wish I was your lover
I wish that you were mine
Baby I got this feeling
That I just can&#8217;t hide
Don&#8217;t try to run away
There&#8217;s many things I wanna say
No matter how it ends
Just hold me when I tell you
I wish I was your lover
I wish that you were mine
Baby I got this feeling
That I just can&#8217;t hide
I wish I was your lover
I wish that you were mine

Tells her I love you
Holds on to her hand

She walks with a smile
she&#8217;s so full of life
But she cries in the night
Just to tryin to hold on
No one can hear her
She&#8217;s all alone
This little girl 
closes her eyes
all that she wants
is someone to love
Someone to love
Little girl
She&#8217;s all grown up
Oh she&#8217;s getting famous
she&#8217;s a big star
Oh little girl
Fights with her mom
Can&#8217;t believe money
Changed who she loved
And she cries in the night
Just to trying to hold on
But no one can hear her
She&#8217;s all alone
This little girl 
closes her eyes
all that she wants
is someone to love
oh yeah

Lyrics By : Manav (Yuvraj)

they say love is just a game
they say time can heal the pain
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
and i guess i'm just a fool
i keep holding on to you
i told you once you were the one
you know that i'd die for you
Although it hurts to see you go
oh this time you should know
i won't try to stop you
don't you forget about me baby
don't you forget about me now
some day you'll turn around and ask me, 
why did i let you go
so you try to fake a smile
you don't wanna break my heart
i can see that you're afraid
but baby its too late
coz I'm already dying
dont you forget about me baby
dont you forget about me now
some day you'll turn around and ask me, 
why did i let you go
dont you forget about me baby
dont you forget about me now
some day you'll turn around and ask me, 
why did i let you go
dont you forget about me baby
dont you forget about me now
some day you'll turn around and ask me, 
why did i let you go
why did i let you go

Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up

I can't wake up

Wake me up
(Bid my blood to run)
I can't wake up

You can't just leave me

Save me
(Save me from the nothing I've become)

I've been living a lie

There's nothing inside
Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything

Without thought, without voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

Wake me up
(Wake me up inside)
I can't wake up
(Wake me up inside)
Save me
(Call my name and save me from the dark)

Wake me up
(Bid my blood to run)
I can't wake up
(Before I come undone)
Save me
(Save me from the nothing I've become)

I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me, I've been alone all along

When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me, me, me</td>

Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as they`re falling tell a story

In my field of paper flowers

I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me

Don`t say I`m out of touch
With this rampant chaos, your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape

And watch my purple sky fly over me

Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights
Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The Goddess of imaginary light

In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
(Paper flowers)
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you

Holding on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known
I should have known

I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
By mistake, I didn't want to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet

Lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now

And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late to catch me now

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look now, the
sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so
mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough
away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their
names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me
stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better
than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven
dwarfs
And Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole
wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm takin' this chance to
say
That I had the best day with you today

[Chester Bennington]
Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall

[Busta Rhymes]
As you can see i survived the worst
But my life is glorious (uh!)
But I know that I leaped every hurdle
And I'm so victorious (uh!)
Take a look I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus (yeah)
As force securin' the win, but they
Believe I'm so notorious (yeah)
You know that I've been 'bout my bread
Even though we rappin' now (yes)
We used to live on the strip even though
a nigga higher level trappin' now (oh!)
Superseded everyone of my little struggles and (uh!)
So your head never ever been an option (trust)
you see my nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And I'm about to take the hood shoppin' (get it!)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington (Busta Rhymes)]
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall (come on)
Forever we waited (ah hah)
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road
(To the riches)
on the road
(To the ghetto)
on the road
(In the projects, to this bangin' instrumental)
on the road
(Rise with me)
on the road
(We come and get it)
on the road

[Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
When it all got started we were steadily
Just getting rejected
And it seemed like nothin' we could do
would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed at the worst
They probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle
Just the way to connect it
I was fighting through every rhyme
Tightening up every line
Never restin' the question if I

Was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it and let it die
So we put the chips on the table and
Told them to let it ride, sing it (yeah)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington (Busta Rhymes)]
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall (come on)
Forever we waited (ah hah)
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road
(To the riches)
on the road
(To the ghetto)
on the road
(In the projects, to this bangin' instrumental)
on the road
(Rise with me)
on the road
(We come and get it)
on the road

Yeah, yeah, yeah, look

In case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin'
The shit that I can leave for
My children's (children's) children's (children)
Now on the wake up I smile, to see how far I've come (yeah)
Fighting for sales when I'm stripped
To negate the hustle from (yeah)
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son (yeah)
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russel was (yeah nigga)
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it (oh!)
Let's make a toast to the hustle
Regardless how you get it, sing it

[Chorus: Chester Bennington (Busta Rhymes)]
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall (come on)

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know; time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I've been diggin' in the crates ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and big bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I can start blessin' it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords and double helixes
To show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So, you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones

I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfied my rhymes Jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood type's krylon, Technicolor type A

On highways write with road rage
Cages a winning, cages a tin that bounce all around
Surround sound, devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things

Sing song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics
Forth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands in attention

Meant to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out at your flaws
Spin, rah, blah, blah, blah, you can say you saw

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
(I'm about to break)

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance

Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
(Just like before)

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe

Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
(I'm about to break)

Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge)

Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left

I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)

So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too and
Your paranoia's probably worse

I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)

So you know that when it's time to sink or swim

That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back

Something has been taken from deep inside of me
The secret I've kept locked away no one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show they never go away
Like moving pictures in my head for years and years they've played

(If I could change I would take back the pain I would)
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would)
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would)

Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

(If I could change I would take back the pain I would)
(Retrace every wrong move that I made I would)
(If I could stand up and take the blame I would)

All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
It's so much simpler than change

Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there

Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I'll make you face this
I pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this loud

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away

You were so scared
But no one would listen
'Cause no one else cared

After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I'm done here?

So if you're asking me
I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed

And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest

Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating
I've shed but I'm me

I'm strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I've never been perfect
But neither have you

So if you're asking me
I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed

Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty

Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest

Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I can't be who you are

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed

Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest

Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are

&#8230;Room to breathe
'Bout to&#8230;
Break
Breathe
I'm about to break
Breathe
I need room to breathe
Breathe
I need room to breathe
Breathe
I need room to breathe

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Just like before
Like before
Like before
Like before
Like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me&#8230;
And I'm about to break (Like before)
I need a little room to breathe&#8230;
And I'm about to break (Like before)
Everything you say to me&#8230;
And I'm about to break (Like before)
I need a little room to breathe&#8230;
And I'm about to break (Like before)

[Verse 3: Jonathan Davis, Chester Bennington]
These are the places where I can feel
Torn from my body, my flesh, it peels
During this ride, we can cut up what we like (I'm about to break)
Waiting alone, I cannot resist
Feeling this hate I have never missed
Please, someone give me a reason to rip off my face
Blood is a-pouring, and pouring, and pouring
And pouring, and pouring, and pouring, and pouring
And pouring, and pouring, and pouring, and pouring (Shut up when I'm talkin' to you)
[Bridge: Chester Bennington, Jonathan Davis]
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up when I'm talkin' to you
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up (Blood is pouring)
Shut up
I'm about to break

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Jonathan Davis, with Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me&#8230; I'm about to break

Everything you say to me&#8230; and I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe&#8230; and I'm about to&#8230;
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe

I'm about to break)

Yo, I don&#8217;t think y'all ready

Graffiti decorations under a sky of grey
This constant apprehension still giving me away
The lessons I've forgotten in spite of all I've learned

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington &amp; Mike Shinoda]

Point the finger at me again

Point, point the finger at me again

And open up my mind (And open up my mind)

Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of grey

All my talk of starting over, these words were never true

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that watches every time I lie
Face that laughs every time I fall
And watches everything
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington &amp; Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 2: Rasco]
Hey yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real but in my mind
I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds, hundred degrees
My soul, bleeds devil must have planted the seed
Now it feels like my backs against the wall I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust, they screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the flames
[Verse 3: Planet Asia]
All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I wanna do is smoke and blast a beat
But something keeps talking to me consciously
Responsibly, it keeps haunting me
From dusk till dawn everything has something for ya
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off the skin I'd probably find another person
There's nothing worse than trying to bring yourself up back from the dead
So I advise you listen to that voice in the back of your head

[Chorus: Chester Bennington &amp; Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
[Bridge: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down (It's like I'm paranoid)
I feel the light betray me
The sun (Can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin)
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
Like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin

[Outro: Chester Bennington &amp; Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
Like a whirl whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn&#8217;t give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one

It makes me think of how you act to me you do
Favors then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me about
Things that you want back from me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

Sick of you acting like I owe you this

But you flop that bomb as you drop that bomb

Take it to the john in your Babylon
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on
I don&#8217;t really give a dang, you pissed on my lawn
Took a dump like a punk, now the battle&#8217;s on
So sick of you stressing, sick of you fessing
Sick of you acting like I owe you some
Find another place to feed your face
If you don&#8217;t, we gon&#8217; bump, get it up, get crunk

Nothing but my own mistakes
Staring back at me, asking why

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
We're stuck in a place so dark, you can hardly see
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
And duck away into the darkness, time's up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington &amp; Mike Shinoda]

At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rot that's all around
Watching the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows, captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by
And a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rock with antennas on top
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The sane lose, not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change, the box stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday, I'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Chali 2Na &amp; Mike Shinoda]
Yo, from the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me

[Verse 3: Chali 2Na]
I'm here at this podium talking, the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring (What's happening?)
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants, causing urban collapse
And bullets that scar souls with dark holes
Get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal (For real)
This society's deprivation depends
Not on our differences, but the separation within
No reparation is made, limited aid on minimum wage
Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague
I'm the forgotten
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up</td>

Hey, yo, when this first started off it was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle came Motion Man
And at the end of it all, it was KutMasta Kurt with a remix

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
When I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Verse 2: Motion Man]
Ay, yo, one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, hah, I so-socialize
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shaked, and made eye contact
Partied and toasted strong, all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No opportunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up, you weaken your system
And had to throw it up
I brought you back into things
Like imaginary man of your dreams
You'd always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt leather, never pleather
Real bringing the pleasure
By any means, it means I'm leaving your team
Hell of a team, man, it seems but I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
'Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all, scared to fall
And hadn't even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run, with you mocking me
Stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now, chock full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Outro: Chester Bennington]

Yo, yo, forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame, puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away, if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You like to think you're never wrong)
You have to act like you're someone
(You have to act like you're someone)

You want someone to hurt like you
(You want someone to hurt like you)
You want to share what you've been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You like to think you're never wrong)
You have to act like you're someone
(You have to act like you're someone)

Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm 'aight)

They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac

Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?

When my jaws get to bumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned

I'm-a tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head wit' a bottle of bub

Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
You know it's true

There's no love like your love
And no other could give more love
There's nowhere unless you're there
All the time, all the way, yeah

Look into your heart, babe
Oh yeah

Ohh, you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for

Everything I do, darling
And we'll see it through
Oh we'll see it through
Oh yeah

Look into your heart
Look into your soul

Oh yeah

She'd walk by on her way to work - n' make the air smell so sweet,
I used to sit in a coffee shop - Sometimes I'd have a cup,
And when she'd go by - She'd light up the sky like the sun coming up.

She be standin' by the bus stop - Driver opened up the door,
I'd just sit n' watch her - Gettin' on the 104,
I wanna give her my number - I wanna tell her my name,
Wanna climb on board that cross-town bus,
Take a chance she feels the same.

It's just another East Side story,
Everybody's got a tale to tell,
Like a hundred guys before me,
I fell under her spell,
(It's just another East Side story.)

Some things you hold on to - n' some you just let go,
It seems like the ones that you can't have are the ones you want the most,
I think about her sometimes - I wonder if she was real,
And if I ever find her I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

It's just another East Side story,
Everybody's got a tale to tell,
Like a hundred guys before me,
I fell under her spell.
Yeah, her spell.

Still the same old story - Still the same old game,
Up there on the East Side - Life goes on the same,
She never knew my number - Never even knew my name,
She climbed on board that cross-town bus I never saw her again.

It's just another East Side story,
Everybody's got a tale to tell,
Like a hundred guys before me,
I fell under her spell,
Her spell, her spell,
Yeah, it's just another East Side story,
Just another East Side Story,
Just another East Side Story.

It's just another East Side story.</td>

Always askin' questions - never did what I was told

I don't wanna hear no lies

And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there

Hey

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in

You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

Yay

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Dreaming once so colourful
Becomes black and white

Loving once so wonderful
Is no longer here
So I'll keep this feeling

Yeah... Ha Ha!
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cos I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hearable
What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy
Lifeless
To know the definition for what life is
Priceless
For you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?
Gunsmokin' righteous with one token
Psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence the basics
Without it you make it
Allow me to make this
Child, like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child and beast
Every cloud you see
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion heprovides
with me as a guide
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing, remember
(that it's all in your head)

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true...

Hello?

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, "Scat, skittle, sca-bobble"
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcometh by thoughts of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, "Look alive!"
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle
And these girls keep Passin' Me By
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, "my, my, my"

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Bridge]
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Outro]
I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish</td>

Tryin' to catch me ridin' 
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

Police think they can see me lean;
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen.
For me to see me ride by, they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen.
Ride with a new chick, she like "Hold up."
Next to the Playstation controller
There's a full clip in my pistola;
Turn a jacker into a coma.
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone;
Just tryin' to make you horny, ain't tryin' to have no babies.
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies.
Law's on patrol; you know they hate me.
Music turned all the way up and to the maximum;
I can speak for some niggas tryin' to jack for some.
But we packin' somethin' that we have
And, um, will have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell. I'm grippin' oak.
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow.
Twins steady twistin' like hit this dough;
Pull up from behind and im sittin low.
Windows down, gotta stop pollution.
CDs change; niggas like "Who is that producin'?"
This the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'.

They see me rollin';
They hatin'.
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

I been drinkin' and smokin'; holdin' shit
'Cause a brother can't focus.
I gotta get to home 'fore the po-po's scope
This big ol Excursion
Swervin',
All up in the curve, man.
Nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey
And the gin again
Is in again;
We in the wind.
Doin' a hundred while I come from the block
And rollin another one up;
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck.
I got a revolver in my right hand;
40 oz on my lap, freezing my balls
Roll a nigga tree, green leaves and all.
Comin' up pretty deep, me and my do-jo.
I gotta get to backstreets;
Wanted by the six-pounds
And I got heat.
shots to the block;
We creep-creep. Pop-pop.
Hope cops don't see me;
On a low key.
With no regard for the law,
We dodge 'em like fuck-'em-all.
But I won't get caught up
And brought up
On charges for none of y'all.
Keep a gun in car
And a blunt to spark,
But, well, if you want,
Nigga,poppin'you dark.
Ready or not, we gon' bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire.

They see me rollin';
They hatin'.

Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

Do what you thinkin' so,
I tried to let you go.
Turn on my blinker light
And then I swang it slow.
And they upset for sure
'Cause they think they know
That they catchin me with plenty of the drinkin' drough.
So they get behind me,
Tryin' to check my tags.
Look at my rearview and they smilin',
Thinkin' they'll catch me on the wrong; keep tryin'
'Cause they denyin' it's racial profilin'.
Houston, TX, you can check my tags;
Pull me over, try to check my slab.
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast.
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them,
Givin' a damn 'bout not feeling my attitude.
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood.
I'ma laugh at you
And then I have to cruise.
You're a number two
On some old DJ Screw.
You can't arrest me plus you can't sue.
This a message to the law; tells 'em "We hate you."
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known.
Tippin' down; I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome.
Bookin' my phone; findin' a chick I wanna bone.
Like they couldn't stop me I'mma bout to pull up at your home
And it's on.

They see me rollin';
They hatin'.
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

It's a whiteout of emotion
And I've only got my brittle bones
To break the fall

When the love in letters fade
It's like moving in slow motion
And we're already too late if we arrive at all

And then we're caught up in the arms race
An involuntary addiction
And we're shedding every value our mothers taught

So will you please show me your real face
Draw the line in the horizon

Until I made some tender coin
Then I met some ladies from Marin
We took the highway to the One
Up the coast to catch some sun
They left me with these blisters on my skin

Don't know what I was on
But I think it grows in Oregon
So I kept on going, going, gone, right through
I drove into Seattle rain
Fell in love then missed the train
That could've took me right back home to you

Every day's so caffeinated
I wish they were Golden Gated
Fillmore couldn't feel more miles away
So, wrap me up return to sender
Let's forget this 5 year bender
Take me to my city by the Bay

I never knew all that I had
Now Alcatraz don't sound so bad
At least they'd have a hella fine merlot
If I could wish upon a star
I would hitch a cable car
To the place that I can always call my home

And plummet out of sight and sound

The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake and thinking of the weekend we were in love

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside

I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high to sing the world goodbye

I am floating away, lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades, still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing and we can go anywhere

Are you there?
Are you there or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

I am floating away, lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you

It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good

[Verse 2]
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

[Verse 3]
Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me
For me

[Verse 4]
Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
It's a new life
For me

And I'm feeling good

I'm feeling good
I feel so good
I feel so good</td>

We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say "I love you," enough
Till it's too late, it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you, what would you wish you would've done?

Yeah, we gotta stop
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given if
This is all we got then we gotta stop thinking that
Every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or throw it all away
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying

And if you plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
So when we long for absolution, there'll be no one on the line

Like we're dying (x4)

You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till its head on
Why we think we're right when we're dead wrong,
You never know a good thing till it's gone

Like we're dying (x4)</td>

[Intro: Apolo Novax]
Proyecto Gotan...
Desde el Koxmoz para el mundo...
Buenos Aires Argentina...
Si, soy yo y la voz de mi pensamiento...
Mis pensamientos...
Pensamientos del coraz&#243;n...

[Verso 1: Apolo Novax]
&#191;C&#243;mo es la clave, cu&#225;l el secreto para estar en paz por completo?
Dos pies en la tierra y un relato desde hace rato me tienen sujeto
El mundo es mi suelo, el cielo mi techo, Buenos Aires donde cosecho mis anhelos y mis pasiones
Pero solo hay vac&#237;o y no estoy satisfecho

Si hablo de amor s&#233; que la extra&#241;o, de mis actos en vida soy due&#241;o
Pero me calla el dolor por el da&#241;o, es como un sue&#241;o dentro de otro sue&#241;o
Apuesto a pleno pero de callado, cada uno en la suya, yo ando rayado
Sigo esperando sentado que esta vez el destino no me deje plantado
No, que no me deje plantado
No nena... escuchame bien... no es chamuyo...es amor

[Verso 2: Chili Parker]
Me la bati&#243; un gom&#237;a che, la culpa no fue m&#237;a
De amor yo no s&#233; nada, lo m&#237;o es la astronom&#237;a
Vos sabias bien que yo era un mamarracho, vos lo sabias bien... soy un borracho
As&#237; que ya no me reclames no me esperes flaca ya no me llames
Todos lo saben prefiero ser MC
Hasta el farolito de la calle en que nac&#237;

Tengo una balada para un loco, que la compuse yo, para mi, porque estoy loco
Y eso me provoc&#243; que en vos pensase y as&#237; un poema nace
Los m&#225;s h&#225;biles dejamos pasar los abriles, inm&#243;viles para no quedar como giles
Y as&#237; ya no me enamoro de nuevo... as&#237; ya no me enamoro de vos de nuevo

[Estribillo: Apolo Novax]
Pensamientos del coraz&#243;n
Son mi confesi&#243;n (&#191;Qu&#233;?)... Tampoco mi inspiraci&#243;n
Pensamientos del coraz&#243;n
Son mi confesi&#243;n (que se yo, pero s&#233; que no es chamuyo)... Tampoco mi inspiraci&#243;n

Pensamientos del coraz&#243;n
Son mi confesi&#243;n (&#191;Qu&#233;?)... Tampoco mi inspiraci&#243;n
Pensamientos del coraz&#243;n
Son mi confesi&#243;n (que se yo, pero s&#233; que no es chamuyo)... Tampoco mi inspiraci&#243;n

Professional, drinkin X and ooo 
Hold up wait a minute, do i see what I think I 
Whoa 
Did I think I seen shorty get low 
Ain't the same when it's up that close 
Make it rain, I'm makin it snow 
Work the pole, I got the bank roll 
Imma say that I prefer them no clothes 
I'm into that, I love women exposed 
She threw it back at me, I gave her more 
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes 
She had them 

[Chorus:]

Apple Bottom Jeans [Jeans] 
Boots with the fur [With the fur] 
The whole club was lookin at her 
She hit the flo [She hit the flo] 
Next thing you know 
Shawty got low low low low low low low low

And the Reeboks with the straps [With the straps] 
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack [Ayy]

[Verse 2:]

Hey 
Shawty what I gotta do to get you home 
My jeans full of gwap 
And they ready for Shones 
Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown 
Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan 
One stack (come on) 
Two stacks (come on) 
Three stacks (come on, now that's three grand) 
What you think I'm playin baby girl 
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands 
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder 
I knew it was ova, that Henny and Cola 
Got me like a Soldier 
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her 
So lucky oo me, I was just like a clover 
Shorty was hot like a toaster 
Sorry but I had to fold her, 
Like a pornography poster 
She showed her 

[Chorus:]

Apple Bottom Jeans [Jeans] 
Boots with the fur [With the fur] 
The whole club was lookin at her

Lil mama took my cash,

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kinda sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make it like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over

But had me believin it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know-oh-oh

But you didn't have cut me off
Make it like it never happened and that we were nothing (oh)
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so rough

(oh)

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect you records
And then change your number (oh)
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (now your just somebody that I used to know)
That I used to know
Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (somebody) (now your just somebody that I used to know)

My, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say "Oh, my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet

It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oak town
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy
(You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know
(You can't touch this)

Look at my eyes, man
(You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
(You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now, you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat

While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that

Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

Yo, I told you
(You can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man?
(You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka
(You can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' about the Hammer, you talkin' about a show

That's hype and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the nineties to burn

The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
You can't touch this, you can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Go with the funk, it is said
If you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead

So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair

This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump

Yeah
(You can't touch this)
Look, man
(You can't touch this)

You better get hype, boy
Because you know you can't
(You can't touch this)b
Ring the bell, school's back in

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic

Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo, Hammer"
And the rest can go and play

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Yeah, you can't touch this
I told you, you can't touch this
Too hype, can't touch this
Get way outta here, you can't touch this</td>

You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back</td>

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable
Than my own meandering experience, I will dispense this advice now

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind
You will never understand the power
And the beauty of your youth until they've faded
But trust me, in twenty years
You will look back at photos of yourself

And recall in a way you can't grasp now
How much possibility lay before you
And how fabulous you really looked
You are not as fat as you imagine

Don't worry about the future or worry that know that worrying
Is as affective as trying to solve an algebra equation
By chewing bubble gum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things
That never crossed your worried mind
The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday

Do one thing every day that scares you, sing
Don't be reckless with other peoples' hearts
Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours, floss
Don't waste your time on jealousy
Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind
The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself

Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults
If you succeed in doing this, tell me how
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements, stretch
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what to do with your life

The most interesting people
I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't
Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to knees, you'll miss them when they're gone

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the "Funky Chicken"
On your 75th wedding anniversary
Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
Or berate yourself either
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body, use it every way you can
Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it

It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own, dance
Even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room
Read the directions even if you don't follow them
Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Brother and sister together will make it through
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings, they are your best link to your past
And the people most likely to stick with you in the future
Understand that friends come and go
But a precious few, who should hold on

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle
For as the older you get, the more you need the people
You knew when you were young
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard
Live in northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft

Travel, accept certain inalienable truths
Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old
And when you do, you'll fanaticise that when you were young
Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble
And children respected their elders

Respect your elders, don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse
But you'll never know when either one will run out
Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're forty
It will look eighty-five
Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it

Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of
Wishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off
Painting over the ugly parts and recycling for more than it's worth
But trust me on the sunscreen

Brother and sister together will make it through, oh yeah
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Everybody's free, oh yeah, everybody's free, oh yeah, oh, to feel good</td>

Milo....
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it&#161;&#175;s like 
to be hated
To be faded 
to telling only lies
As my conscious seems to be
But my dreams they aren&#161;&#175;t as empty
I have hours, only lonely
As my conscious seems to be
My love is vengeance
I have hours, only lonely
That&#161;&#175;s never free
My love is vengeance
No one knows what its like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
and I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain woe
Can show through
That&#161;&#175;s never free
&#206;&#210;&#210;&#187;&#214;&#177;&#212;&#218;&#215;&#183;&#203;&#230;&#215;&#197;&#203;&#251;

Where is my milo.....
Where is my love.....
No one knows what its like
To be mistreated
to be defeated
Behind blue eyes
And no one know how to say
That they&#161;&#175;re sorry
and don&#161;&#175;t worry
I&#161;&#175;m not telling lies
But my dreams they aren&#161;&#175;t as empty
But my dreams they aren&#161;&#175;t as empty
As my conscious seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That&#161;&#175;s never free
No one knows what it&#161;&#175;s like
No one knows what it&#161;&#175;s like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
I wish it was
all than easy
I wish I wish
I wish I wish
I wish it was
all than easy
where is my milo&#163;&#191;.....
Where is my love&#163;&#191;.....

In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleepin' pill

She never drinks the water
Makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane!

Hear my heart burst

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt
this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Or face it all 
together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Or face it all together
At skyfall

Is at skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
When worlds collide, and days are dark
You may have my number, 
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all... together

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)

(When it crumbles)

(We will stand tall)

(let the sky fall)

(When it crumbles)

(We will stand tall)

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know i'd never be me
without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all... together
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)

I'm looking for someone to call, baby
But right now I got a situation
Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins
Big rings, champagne
My life is like a ball game
But instead I'm in the trap, though
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl

And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right, it's better than your's
I could teach you, but I have to charge

Reaching out to know us
To feel our might

Oh... this restless hope in you
Please... try and help us
Stand on our own

As we stopped on this pavement
And saw your dying mind

Paper, for which you're killing brothers life

Help you, we cannot trust you
We cannot understand
Your people's proud destruction
Of their own land

Oh... we're flying on from you
We... will not stay to see your fate

Watch them fly away
Watch them fly away
See the lines across the sky
Watch them fly... away</td>

Always find my place among the ashes

You ready? Let's go!
Yeah!
For those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this, y'all, c'mon!

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name (Mike!)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's picking it up, let's go

[Verse 2: Tak]
Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help (Help), or to get some respect ('Spect)
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds to the skill of an artist

[Verse 3: Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill (Uh), eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill (Next)
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method "Name of the Game" (Uh-huh)
Came back, dropped "Megadef," took 'em to church
I like "Bleach", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse (Ha-ha)
This dude is the truth, now, everybody giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fucking with S. Dot

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Verse 4: Ryu]
They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Verse 5: Tak]
Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
"Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?"
No, he's living proof (Proof), got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (Juice)
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

[Verse 6: Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head, every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah! Fort Minor, M. Shinoda, Styles of Beyond

[Bridge]
One day just gonna see me
Look back and forth from the ceiling
(I'm wide open)
Some day love's gonna hurt me
Turn back and soon I'll believe it

[Chorus]
Slow me down
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
Slow me down
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me

[Outro]
I'm wide open
I'm wide open
Slow me down
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me
It's getting away from me</td>

Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe

You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

(Last night all I think about is you
Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't wanna but I think about you
You know that I'm never gonna do)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in&#8212;

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new

I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June

Can't make you happier now

Keiner sieht ihn an;
Und die Hunde knurren

Und er l&#228;&#223;t es gehen

She arrived one February morning, pale and shellshocked, from past lives I could not imagine
She was 3 years older than me, but in no time we became friends
We'd listen to her mix tapes; Dead Can Dance, Felt, This Mortal Coil...
She introduced me to her favourite books, gave me clothes, and my first cigarette
Sometimes we would head down to Blackbirds moor to watch the barges on Grand Union in the twilight
She said "The water has no memory"
For a few months everything about our lives was perfect
It was only us, we were inseparable
But gradually she passed into another distant part of my memory
Until I could no longer remember her face, her voice, even her name

We have got, we have got the perfect life</td>

There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed

And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you tenderly

Gonna join in a rock and roll band
Got to get back to the land
And set my soul free"

We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song
And a celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust, we are golden
We are caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves

Like Thomas funky Edison
Been in the desert for forty seven days
Purple Haze
The poison that I tasted never changed
Turn up the woofers so I can feel the beat
Vibrate my belly like a bomb in harmony
Summer heat
My back is sticking to me to the seat
Bare feet
Tank top and shorts is all ya need
Summer breeze
I'm feelin' kinda fine
I'm rollin with my shorty all the time
Wind and grind lovely shake your behind
Cinnamon skin be bringing sin to my mind
But whether or not the weather's hot
Or the weather's cold
I'm wrapping her like a blanket with my whole soul
So that she can feel me
Like Coca Cola I'm the woo-o-oh oh the sweet thing
My girl lollipop she growing mad crops
She rollin' herbs everyday
At about 4 o' clock
Tick tock
Strike the hammer while the Iron's hot
Ooh girl watcha got cooking in the pot

See Mary Mary quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
Hydrophonic ultra supersonic
Or does it grow naturally slow?

I love tha way ya love me and the way ya misbehavin'
Ganja babe my sweet ganja babe
Come wake body-ody take my mind away

Everybody get down and do the boogaloo
Just like the cover of I want you
Yoo hooo look watcha gonna do
Watcha gonna do when the rent comes due
Round up the posse and call up the crew
5 Bucks at the door and ya bring ya own booze
Call ya neighbor 'cause they can come too
Be sure and bring ya records 'cause I only got a few
So baa baa black sheep have you any wool
Yes sir, yes sir a nickle bagful
One for my partner one for my crew
Some for my ganja baby she needs to
'Cause just like me they want to be cool

[Rapverse1 (Waqas)]

Don't even go there kid you know I'm out of your damn reach
Your talk is cheap at least I practice what I teach
And when all systems fail you return to the beats
But got nothing to say, the chosen one for defeat
And I spot you in the crowd while I flash in the spotlight
How you wish you could be more like me and bust over beats tight
And reach out to these kids 'cause when I speak you know they listen
I paid the king a visit now he delivers pizza in prison
You said I was bizarre don't watch stars mob floors
You see I was hardcore if you gave me less I made it more
But f*ck that one love baby let's hit for that cheddar
Basically we the same I just make it look better

[Chorus]

[Rapverse2 (Lenny)]

Toma del arroyo de los celos, perros
Te lo digo en la lengua de mi amigo, peelo
Te duele toda rima que yo escribo, y sigo
Siendo en estos montes yo el mero, mero
Hijo de la gran p***
Un momento, respeto a la madre tuya
Porque eres tu quien es la puta
Pobrecito toma mi rima y mis contratos
Quieres estar en mis zapatos
En la supuesta rampa de la fama
No vendas la carne antes mata la vaca
No estas listo nino
Para una guerra verbal
Es a mi al que siempre te van a comparar

[Translation:]

Drink of the rivulet of jealousy, dogs

Now I'll say it in his native tongue, peelo
You hurting by every single rhyme I write, and I keep
Been in this countryside the f*cking one
Son of a b****
Hold it!! Respect to your mama
Coz it is you who's the bitch
Poor little thing, here you have my rhyme and my contracts
You want to be in my shoes
In the so-called spotlight
You know you can't sell the meat before killing the cow
You ain't ready kid
To a verbal war
It will always be me who you gonna be compare to

[Chorus]

[Rapverse3 (Isam)]

You claim that I'm a mammas boy
Cuz I don't smoke or drink alcohol
She claims that I'm criminal like last weeks thief at the mall
Some say I don't sound like hip hop suppose to sound
Ain't got no L.A, N.Y, Dirty South type of sound
That's what I'm trying say
I was born and raised here
Let the Source Magazine cross the sea and represent here
Tell them how we felt the day Pac got shot
While they were screaming pour some liquor
We prayed all night in the mosque
Tell them how best "pop of the year" is "rap of the year"
f*ck being nominated 6 times give me "rock the year"
Ask Jay-B, he'll tell ya, no stormy weather
Not even the ugliest typhoon could ruin this set up
I was laughing, TZZZ!!! All the way to the bank
Changed the whole game based on a pop album prank
Hell next year for the fun of it
We do it again, again and again

You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back</td>

About me
About you
About the way our American hearts beat way down in the bottoms of our chests
About that special feeling we get in the cockles of our hearts
Or maybe below the cockles
Maybe in the sub-cockle area
Maybe in the liver
Maybe in the kidneys
Maybe even in the colon

I like football, and porno, and books about war
I've got an average house
With a nice hardwood floor
My wife, and my job
My kids, and my car
My feet on the table
And a Cuban cigar
But sometimes that just ain't enough
To keep a man like me interested
Oh no, no way, uh uhh
No, I gotta go out and have fun
At someone else's expense
Oh yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

I drive really slow
In the ultra-fast lane
While people behind me are going insane

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, such an asshole)

I use public toilets
And I piss on the seat
I walk around in the summer time sayin', "How about this heat?"

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's the worlds biggest asshole)

Sometimes I park in the handicapped spaces
While handicapped people
Make handicapped faces

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's a real fucking asshole)

Maybe I shouldn't be singin' this song
Ranting and raving and carrying on
Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong...
...
NAAAHHHHH!

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's the world's biggest asshole)

You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadilac El Dorado Convertable
Hot pink!
With whale skin hub caps
An all leather cow interior
And big brown baby seal eyes for headlights
YEAH!
And I'm gonna drive around in that baby
At 115 miles per hour
Getting one mile per gallon
Sucking down Quarter Pounder cheeseburgers from McDonalds in the old-fashioned non-biodegradable Styrofoam containers
And when I'm done sucking down those grease-ball burgers
I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag
And then I'm gonna toss the Styrofoam containers right out the side
And there ain't a Goddamn thing anybody can do about it
You know why?
'Cause we got the bombs, that's why!
Two words: Nuclear Fuckin' Weapons
Okay!?
Russia, Germany, Romania
They can have all the Democracy they want
They can have a big Democracy cake walk
Right through the middle of Tienemen Square
And it won't make a lick of difference
Because we got the bombs
Okay!?
John Wayne's not dead
He's frozen!
And as soon as we find a cure for cancer We're gonna thaw out "The Duke"
And he's gonna be pretty pissed off
You know why?
Have you ever taken a cold shower?
Well, multiply that by 15 million times
That's how pissed off "The Duke"'s gonna be
I'm gonna get "The Duke"
And John Cassavetes
And Lee Marvin
And Sam Peckinpah
And a case of whiskey
And drive down to Texas
And-
(Hey, Hey! You know you really are an asshole)
Why don't you just shut-up and sing the song, pal?
You know, the whole time I thought I was that asshole
And it turns out it was him
What an asshole!

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's the worlds biggest asshole)

A - SS - HO - LE!
Everybody!!
A - SS - HO - LE!

*dog barking noises*

I'm an asshole and proud of it!</td>

Yo, you act like you&#8217;re the only white person that can rhyme

In matter fact you did, aint you just get arrested cause your wife was in a club with some dude bein molested?
Yo, haven&#8217;t you really tried to be a playa
Hey you aint no playa
Walkin with an unloaded gun
Talking about I&#8217;m gonna spray ya
I&#8217;m a real rhyme sayer with some years on ya
You know you really want Britney Spears rib on ya
You couldn&#8217;t handle that body
She&#8217;s a dance
One look at your small dick
She&#8217;d be like &#8220;is that your final answer?&#8221;
Regis Filman might have to fill in
When I&#8217;m still in camp
For every spin up on my jungle gym
No offense to Detroit
But I&#8217;m from New York
Where we talk the talk and where we walk the walk
And after dark you&#8217;re gone
And you&#8217;ve been warned we strong
So when I drop the bomb
From Long Island it&#8217;s on
So the next time when you&#8217;re in NYC
Leavin MTV
No it&#8217;s not VET
Come see me
Put all that money up where your mouth is
Unless you spent it all on your commissary account, kid
I&#8217;m still gonna see ya
After your court day
You know the one where they figure out your child support rate
You might be a raise
But remember I aint caged
I&#8217;m an underage
And you&#8217;re not the only one that&#8217;s crazed
So leave your Dr. Dre&#8217;s
And your empty A-K&#8217;s
Bring your microphone and your pale face
Bring your daughter
Be prepared when she asks, &#8220;Yo dada, why you let that man out rap your ass?&#8221;
Yo slim shady
Yea, you the real shady
But your married wife
Acting like she still a single lady
So the real slim shady needs to shut the fuck up
Cause the last I&#8217;d heard you had got locked up
So to slim shady
This once for you baby
There&#8217;s still cats on the mic that can
Out rap you daily
The real slim shady take back your platinum
Placks
And shove them up your flat platinum ass biatch!</td>

Can't ya see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I wanna roll with the gangsters
But so far they all think I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Really, really white and nerdy

First in my class there at MIT
Got skills, I'm a champion at D&amp;D
MC Escher, that's my favorite MC
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin - to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library
My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin' for my Top 8 spaces
Yo, I know pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills, but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper, I could play for days
Once you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast, I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer app I haven't run
At Pascal, well, I'm number one
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat, but I got a soldering gun
"Happy Days" is my favorite theme song
I could sure kick your butt at a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon
Here's the part I sing on

They see me roll on my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't ya see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I'd like to roll with the gangsters
Although it's apparent I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy?

I've been browsin', inspectin'
X-Men comics, you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shoppin' online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized "Holy Grail" really well
I can recite it right now and have you ROTFLOL
I got a business doin' websites
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all
Even made a home page for my dog
Yo, I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin' a sale down at The Gap
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop pop, hope no one sees me gettin' freaky
I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
I was in A/V Club and Glee Club and even the chess team
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was, do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Faire
Got my name on my underwear

They see me strollin' they laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy
I wanna bowl with the gangsters
But oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy</td>

Fat and weak, what a disgrace
Guess the champ got too lazy
Ain't gonna fly now, he's just takin' up space
Sold his gloves, threw his eggs down the drain
But he's no bum, he works down the street
He bought the neighborhood deli
Back on his feet, now he's choppin' up meat
Come inside, maybe you'll hear him say:

[Chorus 1:]
Try the rye or the kaiser
They're on special tonight
If you want, you can have an appetizer
You might like our salami, and the liver's all right
And they'd really go well with the rye
Or the kaiser

[Verse 2:]
Never eats while on the job
He heard it's good to stay hungry
But he makes a pretty mean shish kabob
Have a taste, they were made fresh today

[Chorus 2:]
Try the rye or the kaiser or the wheat or the white
Maybe I can suggest an appetizer
Stay away from the tuna, it smells funny tonight
But you just can't go wrong with the rye
Or the kaiser

[Verse 3:]
So today, his deli comes first
Still he dreams of his past days of glory
Goes in the back and beats up on the liverwurst
All the while you can still hear him say:

[Chorus 3:]
It's the rye or the kaiser, it's the thrill of one bite
Let me please be your catering advisor
If you want substitutions, I won't put up a fight
You can have your roast beef on the rye
Or the kaiser

The rye or the kaiser
The rye or the kaiser
The rye or the kaiser...</td>

Pizza party at your house,
I went just to check it out.
19 extra larges,
What a shame, no one came.
Just us, eatin' all alone,
You said take the pizza home.
No sense lettin' all this go to waste,
So then I faced

Pizza all day, and everyday, there's cheese round the clock,
It's gettin' me blocked, And I sure don't care, for
irregularity.

Tell me,
Why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
Cos' right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated,
In the bathroom.
I sit and I wait and I strain and I sweat and I clench and I
feel the pain
Oh, should've taken laxatives or had my colon irrigated.
No, no, no.

I was feelin' pretty down,
'Til my girlfriend came around.
We're just so alike in every way, I gotta say.
In fact, I just thought I might,
pop the question there that night.
I was kissing her so tenderly,
But woe is me.

Who would have guessed, her family crest.
I suddenly spy, tattoo'd on her thigh.
And son of a gun, it's just like the one on me.
Tell me.

How was I supposed to know we were both related?
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin we never would have
dated.
What to do now?
Should I go ahead and propose and get hitched and have kids with
11 toes,
And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated.
No, no, no.

(no no no)

Ooh, I had so much on my mind,
I thought maybe I'd unwind.
Try out that new roller coaster ride,
And the guide...

Said not to stand, but that's a demand,
That I couldn't meet, I got on my feet,
And stood up instead and knocked off my head you see.
Tell me.

Why'd I have to go and get myself decapitated?
This really is a major inconvenience, oh man I really hate it.
It's such a drag now.
I can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore, I can't belch or
yodel anymore,
Can't spit or blow my nose or even read Sports Illustrated.
Oh no!

Why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated?
I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated.
What a bummer.
I can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeze.
But my neck is enjoying a pleasant breeze now.
Haven't been the same since my head and I were separated.

Nigger I'm high, nigger you high. (uh huh)

Watch the butterflies, hit the wall,
and if you're feeling down, give yer boy a call!
Weed, it takes the stress away,
thats why Bizarre smokes ten blunts a day.
It's nuffing but the sticky, icky, green stuff!
Line it, pass it and take a puff!
Having a bad day, stop by my house,
coz most likely, I've got a blunt in my mouth.
So sit down relax and chill,
and if ya don't smoke weed, then shit, I got sum pills!
Watch ya need girl,

and sum happy meals?
Nah, baby, I don't smoke no porks,

Only church I know, a snoop dogg's studio.

Wide out the raps, blowing in my lap,
Rap hennesy, keep the acid tap.
I'm glad, that I didnt't go down south,
Take care of my kids, be the man of the house,
orange mushrooms, and yellow stars,
Fat bags of weed[???]
Get in and lap, come on jump in,
Raid a bottle of gin, and two of your freaky friends
O f*ck it! Let's go to see the point,
Bring your son alone, shit, he can hit the joint,
Cause rapping, it's a full time job!
All I wanna smoke weed and praise God!

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick - ha ha!
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin

(Swifty)
Bitch it's too late

(Eminem)
Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin, creatin murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face {*BLAM*}
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin every penny - it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin, I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin me they bracelets
Chillin in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin - throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

Slashin your tires, flyin down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?) Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*}
Lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*}
Lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*} (Damn!)
{*DJ reverses the record and scratches it back on beat*}
I'm fuckin anything when I'm snortin
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
{*dog whines*} Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin ass mom

(Proof)
Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin {*gun cocks*} nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin, get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
and found chopped up in a trash bag

(Kuniva)
We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell
cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a "Luni"
I got a "Yukmouth" and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin "Kuniva yo yo."
I leave ya face leakin, run up in church
and smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

(Kon Artis)
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
(Special delivery!) I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's

You're walking in the woods
There's no one around, and your phone is dead
Out of the corner of your eye, you spot him. (Shia LaBeouf)
He's following you, about 30 feet back
He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint
He's gaining on you! (Shia LaBeouf)
You're looking for your car, but you're all turned around
He's almost upon you now, and you can see there's blood on his face!
My god, there's blood everywhere!

[Chorus 1]
Running for your life from Shia LaBeouf
He's brandishing a knife, it's Shia LaBeouf
Lurking in the shadows, hollywood superstar Shia LaBeouf
Living in the woods, Shia LeBeouf
Killing for sport, Shia LaBeouf
Eating all the bodies, actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf

[Verse 2]
Now it's dark, and you seem to have lost him
But you're hopelessly lost yourself, stranded with a murderer
You creep silently through the underbrush
Aha! In the distance, a small cottage with a light on!
Hope!
You move stealthily toward it, but your leg! Ah! It's caught in a bear trap!
[Chorus 2]
Gnawing off your leg (Quiet, quiet)
Limping toward the cottage (Quiet, quiet)
Now you're on the doorstep
Sitting inside, Shia LaBeouf
Sharpening an ax, Shia LaBeouf
But he doesn't hear you enter, Shia LaBeouf
You're sneaking up behind him
Strangling superstar Shia LaBeouf
Fighting for your life with Shia LaBeouf
Wrestling a knife from Shia LaBeouf
Stab it in his kidney
Safe at last from Shia LaBeouf

[Bridge]
You limp into the dark woods, blood oozing from your stump leg
You've beaten Shia LaBeouf
Wait! He isn't dead! Shia Surprise!
There's a gun to your head, and death in his eyes
But you can do Jiu Jitsu
Body Slam superstar Shia LaBeouf
Legendary fight with Shia LaBeouf
Normal Tuesday night for Shia LaBeouf
You try to swing an axe at Shia LaBeouf
But blood is draining fast from your stump leg
He's dodging every swipe, he parries to the left
You counter to the right, you catch him in the neck
You're chopping off his head now
You have just decapitated Shia LaBeouf
[Outro]
His head topples to the floor, expressionless
You fall to your knees and catch your breath
You're finally safe from Shia LaBeouf</td>

[Big Bank Hank]
I'm Big Bank, I am the Chief
I got a lot of raps but I'll be real
I never need a horse I like to chill
so I, drive up in my new Seville
My Tribe went down in the hall of fame
Cause I'm the one who shot Jesse James
Pound for pound, I will never break down
(Big Bank!) No sir, I don't mess around

Awowowowowowowowowow!! Ho!
Wowowowowowwowowowowowowowowowowow!!

[Chorus]

[Master G]
Like Kemosabi, of course it's me
I'm better known as the Master G
A firing squad, sensed the danger
When they're stung by the rapping ranger
Had a little talk with my medicine man
He said, "Get them squaws, fast as you can"
To all you girls, that wanna join my Tribe
Just move to my rhythm, and feel my vibe
Put up a fuss, in the end you'll agree
When you come inside, my tee-pee
As I said before, you could sense the danger

When you're stung by the rapping ranger
When Silver and I, take a ride
All you suckers better step aside
I sting squaws, then I run away
HIYOO Silver, is what I say!

Ho! Ho! Wowowowowowowowow!
Hit it gang!

Ho! Ho! Ho! Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!

[Chorus]

[Wonder Mike]
A pow-wow, just rock it out
Finger poppin to the break of dawn
Keep it rockin like the stuff that we call maize
(What's that?) Hot buttered popcorn
You just hippa-hoppa-dippa-boppa bang the boogie
woogie betcha wanna boogie again
And you can put me to the test at your request
I rock you out of your mocassins
Kemosabi got down, took off his mask
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
Tommy came along, saw what was happenin
His head began to boppin his foot start to clappin
Go slam, dunk, do the jerk
And with the mic is how my smoke signals work
They were jammin' off a record that said it best:
"Now what you hear is not a test!"

Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga (2X)

Check it out

[Verse 1: Humbert]
Baby girl, you left me, oh no, we broke up
It's been a while since we last spoke, but
I need another chance, can you give me that?
'Cause there's something in my pants that'll win you back
I-hi-hi wanna be your man again
But you left me like I'm Jennifer Aniston
And I know you said you'd never call
But girl, you ain't seen my balls

[Chorus]
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You ain't seen my balls, you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You ain't seen my balls, you ain't seen my balls

[Verse 2: Humbert]
My balls are so awesome, don't get me started
They're so damn big "How big are they?"
They're so big, it's really obnoxious
It's like two Ewoks chillin' in my boxers
They're so big, I can't hold 'em back
Even Cartman's like "man those are fat"
They're so big, they're run over your feet
That's why when they back up, you hear a "beep beep"
And how can I be subtle
When my balls chase Indiana Jones through a tunnel?
And everyone at Disney World keeps telling me
That Epcot Center looks at 'em with jealousy
In fact, when you see 'em on the street they'll
Fight Godzilla to the death in the sequel
I'm guessing soon you'll be hoping I'm back
'Cause my balls are so big, they've got an opening act
[Chorus]
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You ain't seen my balls, you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You-you-you-you ain't seen my balls
You ain't seen my balls, you ain't seen my balls

[Bridge: Humbert, DeeJay]
My balls are so epic, and I ain't boastin'
But they have an effect on the tides in the ocean
And when the sun's right, it might cause
A total solar eclipse of my balls
'Cause these things are where it's happenin'
And when I whip 'em out you'll take me back again
Should I compare 'em to a brontosaurus?
No, excuse me, I'm on the chorus
I, I got what you need
And you'd said you'll never call
But girl, you ain't seen these balls (Here we go)
I-hi-hi wanna be your man again
But you left me like I'm Jennifer Aniston
And I know you said you'd never call
But girl, you ain't seen my
(You ain't seen my, you ain't seen my)
(You ain't seen my, you-you-you-you ain't seen my)
(You ain't seen my, you ain't seen my)
(You-you-you-you ain't seen my)
Girl, you ain't seen my balls

Oh man, im tired!
And a long yet productive day at the studio today
Feeling little good about myself
Just gonna check my facebook and see if I got any messages from old friends of mine
Maybe brag a little bit, Y'know what I mean?

[Verse 1:]
I just updated my status
It says, "Big Wax is the motherfuckin' baddest"
And along comes Katie, from Missouri
Hits the 'Like' button in a hurry
Two minutes later got a worry cause I check my messages
And my girl wants to know who this bitch I had sex with is
I say, "Who?". Up comes the chat box
"Katie." Caps Lock
I typed back, "Girl it ain't like that."
Katie is the girlfriend of my boy Mike that I know from a Psych Lab, he's a college buddy
She typed, "O-M-G. I'm not a dummy."
Her status says 'Single' on the wall
Is that the girl you fucked on tour last fall
So I hit the X, then I get a text, then I get a call
Then I get a tweet at @BigWax "Fuck Y'all"
I hope you and Katie both die
Here's an e-kite you should both go fly
I should've just deleted my page
Fuck that, now I'mma need it to get laid

[Hook:]
Don't be postin' nothin' up on my wall
Stay off my facebook
Stay offa my facebook
And don't be tagging me in nothin' at all
Stay off my facebook
Get up offa my facebook
And now my girlfriend wants to chop of my balls
Stay off my facebook
Stay offa my facebook
It just makes it oh so easy to stalk
Stay off my facebook
Bitch, get off my facebook

[Verse 2:]
Check it out
Yo, drunk pictures, fun at the show
Not cool to everyone that you know
I just had a job interview, it would've been a a great look
Interviewer called me and said he saw my Facebook
He said I ain't gettin' the position
Due to the picture of me nekkid in my kitchen
With a bong in my hand that I just got tagged in
All my friends makin' up their own fake captions
One read, "That's Mike to a T."
And that was the one that was typed by me
Whatever happened to privacy?
My mom got a page just to spy on me
When she first friended me, I fuckin' hated it
Cause she thinks everything's some drug-related shit
What are those little smiley faces for?
Damn It! I should've just hit ignore
Yeah, I'm about to bite the bullet
Delete my page, yeah, tonight I'm gonna do it
Make a fake page with a wrong name and just use it to stalk my ex and play that farm game

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Once and for all, I just want all you motherfuckers to stay off my facebook page
In fact, I'm gonna delete it and make a new one
I'll pick a name of somebody really cool
And have a picture with some dude with chiseled abs
Takin' a picture in front of the mirror
Say I'm from a cool place
Maybe, I'll be from, uh, Anchorage, Alaska, or some shit...</td>

(That's right, that's right)
He's six feet down
(Six feet down)
He only comes around
When he wants to get down
But when he comes out of his hole
He sounds something like this

Oh, that's funky, that's funky
Like nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky
Come on wit' it again, fellas
Come on wit' it
All through all the land, yeah yeah
Sing it
He plays in a band
Plays in a band
Plays guitar without any hands
Pretty good, I might add
Yeah
When he grabs his guitar and starts to pluck
Everybody wants to get up and dance

Ah, get it baby

I'm his manager, heh, yeah
Gonna make a million dollars
I get it all too, he can't spend it
Don't stop now honey, get down

That's it, that's it
Don't, don't,
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight it

OK, that's enough, get out of here
Here we go
People listen to this
Gettin' really funky
Get out of here

Goin' back in his hole
Just the same way he came out

Do we get paid for this?
Yes, of course

Kind to some, but not to thee
Born with a rare and sad disease
She grew &#8212; a ham &#8212; where her head should be
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
Her dream was to be a famous star
But at the rate she was goin', she wasn't going fa-a-ar
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Her father was a simple man (Duh!)
He wanted to help, "in any way that I can!"
Home from school, he watched his daughter cry
In the yard, he cursed God and fired at the sky
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
Her dreams in the sky, her father felt her pain
And as he shot at the clouds, it began to rain
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Got a call from the doctor
He had some amazing news for her
He just developed a cure
If she hurried over now, he'd try it out on her
Burst out the door, she was beaming
Among the raindrops her happy tears were streaming
Finally freed from her pain
But something else fell with the rain
A stray bullet shot by her father
Aimlessly nested inside her
She fell to the the sidewalk, now empty
Of the life which once christened her body
"Nurse, s-she's... she's gone."
"O-oh... oh dear."
"I left a lunch on the table in the operating room for the bereaved, a cooked ham, as is customary for these... dark situations."
"U-uh, Doctor, what... which one is the... which... which one is the ham that&#8212;?"
"I-I must... I must go... I must... I must go, I'm on break."
"Oh dear."
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
At her time of death
The doc said "time to eat!"
So we took a bite out of her face meat
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore (La-la-oh...)
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Soaring infinitely through space
Hamantha's soul was graced
With a glance of our humble planet
At which she was amazed
The news of her untimely death
Had spread out near and far
And through her soul, the truth was whole
The dream had crossed the bar
Hamantha had become a star
Hamantha was finally a star
Hamantha had become a star
Hamantha was finally a star</td>

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb</td>

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever

Moved from side to side

And sail on the steel breeze.

Come on you miner for truth and delusion,

Title: Within You Without You
Album: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

We were talking,

About the space between us all.

And the people,

Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion.

Never glimpse the truth,

Then it's far too late,

When they pass away.

We were talking,

About the love we all could share,

When we find it.

To try our best to hold it there,

With our love, with our love, we could save the world,

If they only knew.

Try to realize it's all within yourself; no one else can make you change.

And to see you're really only very small,
And life flows on within you and without you.

We were talking,

About the love that's gone so cold.

And the people,

Who gain the world and lose their soul.

They don't know,

They can't see,

Are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself,
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there.

And the time will come when you see we're all one,
And life flows on within you and without you.

Brothers and sisters!
We gonna have Church tonight!
And tonight this speaker is, Reverend Ruffus Jackson..

[Chorus:]
I wake up praising, God every day,
I wanna....smoke some weed and roll me the J,
Thankya Jesus! (Thankyou Jesus!)
Thankya Lord! (Thankyou Lord!)
For lettin' me live another day! Hey! hey!

[Verse 1:]
Nigger I'm high, nigger you high. (uh huh)
lets get high in the motherf*cking sky!
Watch the butterflies, hit the wall,
and if you're feeling down, give yer boy a call!
Weed, it takes the stress away,
thats why Bizarre smokes ten blunts a day.
It's nuffing but the sticky, icky, green stuff!
Line it, pass it and take a puff!
Having a bad day, stop by my house,
coz most likely, I've got a blunt in my mouth.
So sit down relax and chill,
and if ya don't smoke weed, then shit, I got sum pills!
Watch ya need girl,
a f*cking refill?
a fat bag a weed
and sum happy meals?
Nah, baby, I don't smoke no porks,
only fat bags of weed in this escort.

[Chorus:]
I wake up praising, God every day,
I wanna....smoke some weed and roll me the J,
Thankya Jesus! [Thankyou Jesus!]
Thankya Lord! [Thankyou Lord!]
For lettin' me live another day! Hey! hey!

[Verse 2:]
Sunday morning, Bizarre have day,
Blunt in my mouth, watching DJ Dre.
Dangerous my, just like Cudio
Only church I know, a snoop dogg's studio.

Wide out the raps, blowing in my lap,
Rap hennesy, keep the acid tap.
I'm glad, that I didnt't go down south,
Take care of my kids, be the man of the house,
orange mushrooms, and yellow stars,
Fat bags of weed[???]
Get in and lap, come on jump in,
Raid a bottle of gin, and two of your freaky friends
O f*ck it! Let's go to see the point,
Bring your son alone, shit, he can hit the joint,
Cause rapping, it's a full time job!
All I wanna smoke weed and praise God!

[Chorus:]
I wake up praising, God every day,
I wanna....smoke some weed and roll me the J,
Thankya Jesus! (Thankyou Jesus!)
Thankya Lord! (Thankyou Lord!)
For lettin' me live another day! Hey! hey!

[Outro:]
Break it down....yea
We gonna slow it down rite here...
We havin' Church up in here tonight, it's the Reverend Rufuss Johnson...
and we sittin' over here,
at sixteen five-o, cone it[?]
and ladies and gentlemen,

[over chorus:]
Baptist,
Catholic,
Jahova Witness,
yea, come praise God,
yea! services, send it,

Just coz you smoke weed don't mean you a sinner! What!?

[Bizarre: speaking]
Just coz you smoke weed don't mean you don't believe in God!
Jesus will keep care of ya! Jesus!
You need Jesus!

Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture

Fab Five Freddie told me everybody's fly
DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind
Flash is fast, flash is cool
Francois sais pas, flashe' no do

And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light

And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head

And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subarus

And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then when there's no more cars
You go out at night and eat up bars

Where the people meet

Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars

He's eatin' bars, yeah, wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure

Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
I said, "Don't stop, do punk rock"

Man to man, body muscular
Seismic decibel by the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder, no sign of bad luck in rapture

Well, now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on

Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot

'Cause the man from Mars
Stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And now he only eats guitars
Get up!</td>

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside, getting high on information
And buy me a star on the Boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Like Thomas funky Edison
Been in the desert for forty seven days

The poison that I tasted never changed
Turn up the woofers so I can feel the beat
Vibrate my belly like a bomb in harmony
Summer heat
My back is sticking to me to the seat
Bare feet
Tank top and shorts is all ya need
Summer breeze
I'm feelin' kinda fine
I'm rollin with my shorty all the time
Wind and grind lovely shake your behind
Cinnamon skin be bringing sin to my mind
But whether or not the weather's hot
Or the weather's cold
I'm wrapping her like a blanket with my whole soul
So that she can feel me
Like Coca Cola I'm the woo-o-oh oh the sweet thing
My girl lollipop she growing mad crops
She rollin' herbs everyday
At about 4 o' clock
Tick tock
Strike the hammer while the Iron's hot
Ooh girl watcha got cooking in the pot

See Mary Mary quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
Hydrophonic ultra supersonic
Or does it grow naturally slow?

I love tha way ya love me and the way ya misbehavin'
Ganja babe my sweet ganja babe
Come wake body-ody take my mind away

Everybody get down and do the boogaloo

Yoo hooo look watcha gonna do
Watcha gonna do when the rent comes due
Round up the posse and call up the crew
5 Bucks at the door and ya bring ya own booze
Call ya neighbor 'cause they can come too
Be sure and bring ya records 'cause I only got a few
So baa baa black sheep have you any wool
Yes sir, yes sir a nickle bagful
One for my partner one for my crew
Some for my ganja baby she needs to
'Cause just like me they want to be cool

All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hearable
What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy
Lifeless
To know the definition for what life is
Priceless

Without it you make it
Allow me to make this
Child, like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child and beast
Every cloud you see
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion heprovides
with me as a guide
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing, remember
(that it's all in your head)

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

Drive on engines 'til they weep
With future pixels in factories far away

All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year

And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

Uh
Mmmmm...

I got a feeling now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul

I prayed on the immovable
Yeah, clinging to the atoms of rocks
Seasons, the adjustments, signs of change

I can't see now she said taxi
Now red light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties, and skies

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Uh
(That's electric)

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time everyday, same routine
Clear target in the summer when skies are blue

It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Natures corrupted in factories far away

(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
Uh
(That's electric)
With future pixels in factories far away

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

I've seen this room and I've walked this floor

It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?

And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City's the place where
They said, "Hey babe
Take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey Joe
Take a walk on the wild side"

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should've seen 'em go, go, go
They said, "Hey sugar
Take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey babe
Take a walk on the wild side"
All right, huh

Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would have helped that bash
She said, "Hey babe
Take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey honey
Take a walk on the wild side"

And the colored girls say:
"Doo do doo do doo do do doo, ..."</td>

You can't touch this

My, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say "Oh, my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet

It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oak town
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy
(You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know
(You can't touch this)

Look at my eyes, man
(You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
(You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now, you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat

While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that

Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

Yo, I told you
(You can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man?
(You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka
(You can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' about the Hammer, you talkin' about a show

That's hype and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the nineties to burn

The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
You can't touch this, you can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Go with the funk, it is said
If you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead

So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair

This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump

Yeah
(You can't touch this)
Look, man
(You can't touch this)

You better get hype, boy
Because you know you can't
(You can't touch this)b
Ring the bell, school's back in

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic

Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo, Hammer"
And the rest can go and play

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Yeah, you can't touch this
I told you, you can't touch this
Too hype, can't touch this
Get way outta here, you can't touch this</td>

Because, you can be like that.
With all that humbleness, and all that respect.
All of the power invested in me
Be it hard to love my enemies.
All of the black bags over the heads of the dead and dying.
The more I understand about the human race
The less I comprehend about our purpose and place
And maybe if there was a clearer line the curiosity would satisfy.
Time based prophecies that kept me from living
In the moment I am struggling
To trust the divinity of all the guides
And what the hell they have planned for us.
I cry for the creatures who get left behind
But everything will change in a blink of an eye
And if you wish to survive
You will find the guide inside.
I go back and forth every single day
The clarity that comes to me in a choppy way
As the feelings
And the places
And the seasons change
The galaxies remain.
Energy fields cone the body in space.
The angels that are coming from a spiritual waste.
The hate that gets me distant from my spiritual pace.
Ten fold the manna when the planets are in place, in polar alignment.
We're on assignment.
Bodies on consignment.
Return them to the circus
And what is the purpose?
What is the purpose and would you believe it?
Would you believe it if you knew what you were for
And how you became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.

And in this existence
I'll stay persistent
And I'll make a difference

I am not a leader, just a creature.
Stick the peaches of my teacher when you follow where they lead.
All mysterious ways of nature and I am in to it.
Changing management.
And there are various ways to conquer this, monotonous, metropolis
My stubbornness is bottomless
My fear is this is talking shit
And I am wide awake and I am taking names.Do you speak to me like you speak to God?
All the love and understanding between the father and the son?
Do you believe in the perfectness of where you are?
He's my people he's my children it's the land that I would fight for.
I saw an ebonese telling me to patiently move the music medicine around the planet in a hurry.
Cuz there's no time to waste.
Got to wake up the people time to stand up and say
We know what we are for
And how we became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.

Made up of particles
And in this existence

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable
Than my own meandering experience, I will dispense this advice now

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind
You will never understand the power
And the beauty of your youth until they've faded
But trust me, in twenty years
You will look back at photos of yourself

And recall in a way you can't grasp now
How much possibility lay before you
And how fabulous you really looked
You are not as fat as you imagine

Don't worry about the future or worry that know that worrying
Is as affective as trying to solve an algebra equation
By chewing bubble gum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things
That never crossed your worried mind
The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday

Do one thing every day that scares you, sing
Don't be reckless with other peoples' hearts
Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours, floss
Don't waste your time on jealousy
Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind
The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself

Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults
If you succeed in doing this, tell me how
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements, stretch
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what to do with your life

The most interesting people
I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't
Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to knees, you'll miss them when they're gone

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the "Funky Chicken"
On your 75th wedding anniversary
Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
Or berate yourself either
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body, use it every way you can
Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it

It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own, dance
Even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room
Read the directions even if you don't follow them
Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Brother and sister together will make it through
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings, they are your best link to your past
And the people most likely to stick with you in the future
Understand that friends come and go
But a precious few, who should hold on

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle
For as the older you get, the more you need the people
You knew when you were young
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard
Live in northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft

Travel, accept certain inalienable truths
Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old
And when you do, you'll fanaticise that when you were young
Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble
And children respected their elders

Respect your elders, don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse
But you'll never know when either one will run out
Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're forty
It will look eighty-five
Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it

Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of
Wishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off
Painting over the ugly parts and recycling for more than it's worth
But trust me on the sunscreen

Brother and sister together will make it through, oh yeah
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Everybody's free, oh yeah, everybody's free, oh yeah, oh, to feel good</td>

try to fix their hair in the rear-view mirrors
you know we're just trying to get to the club
and shake our asses
a caravan of kids, a big old mess
on the old wooden dock, yeah we're bored to death
got a bottle of wine and a fresh pack of smokes
we're gonna end up screaming about some midnight garage sale

so god, put down your gun can't you see we're dead?
god, put down your hand i'm not listening
but the microphone cut off, so we're screaming at the top of our lungs
you were born so fresh, a golden prize
until you screamed at me and quickly realized
that you're lost in a fog on the way to death
oh, a big black line, a thick black line
so you better speak up and raise that voice
come on, scream out all you girls and boys
let's get wild! wild! wild! its a choice

oh, the push and pull of everything
oh, this nightmare of electricity
we are the living dead, yeah, the living dead
that's the way it is, that's the way its always been
oh, the snakes slid past my house today
oh, i heard he caught you on a dark highway

Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't wanna but I think about you
You know that I'm never gonna do)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new

I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

our unreachable backup world,
oh, oh yeah!

[Verse 1]
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Herm&#232;s link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, s?llin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knif? to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo ho if yo bitch keep eyein' me!

Ayo, I'ma explain why you probably never seen me
I'm in a sunken place, no Instagram, I'm watchin' TV
I think I trade my breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some kitty
Please believe me, I see RiRi, I'ma eat it like panini
I go dumb up in the broad, hit the walls like graffiti
Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy
I go crazy in my Yeezy, Kirk Kneezy on the beat
I told 'em now we finna glow up in the street
Rappers talk subliminal but they don't talk to me
Put 'em in a Jersey shore like Pauly D

I have an appointment today. it's probably under 'Lil Dicky,' actually. I'm a&#8230; I'm a rapper, so&#8230;"

"Ok, and who are you here to see?"
"Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here "Snoop D-o-g-g."
"Oh, yeah. He's right down the hall. First door to your right. Give him a knock and he should be right with you."
"Thanks. It's uh, this door right here, right?"
"Mm-hmm."
"Thank you."

Grab a seat

Thanks I'm Dave very nice to meet
Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem, sir, let me just say
I'm a big fan of the shit that y'all make
I can't lie, I been thinking about this all day
All good, there's a reason that we called, Dave, let me start with your background
Where you come from?
Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh, you talking bout my hometown?
Yeah
I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain't never had to struggle for much
I wouldn't say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap
Elaborate
Well I ain't never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad, I'm cool and I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
Know you been racing them rats, you ain't been making them raps
Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started?
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don't diss me buddy, I wasn't one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must've wanted this a lot, I had something to choose
Look at that, I can say there's something to prove up in your ass
Yeah, I guess
That's enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?
Oh my god, it's the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I get a forum to project myself
It's never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It's kinda healthy
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals
Sure
In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh, I wouldn't do shit
And I don't even get what that got to do with this?
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life
If you wanna do this, then you won't get far acting like a little bitch
Nah, that's my niche!
Don't get offended by this, but that's the market y'all missed
That's the target I'll hit
And that's the heart of my pitch
I wanna do this whole thing different
What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?
Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time
But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right?
Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know
You don't know if it could be working even better
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
I don't mean any disrespect by that
I'm just saying I have a different background
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant

So what are your biggest strengths?

Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing
For example, I can be like ain't nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
Ripping this shit like it's never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer
Alright, alright, I get it
Top of that, lyrically I'm pretty damn clever (Go)
Got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe Neville (Whoa)
And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (Oh)
You can say I'm pretty smart how I know better
And y'all been winning like Pistorius, it's no feat
Bro, I can go on and on
I'm taking over and they mad like father-in-laws
OK enough of the punchline, that ain't showing me you different from the other guys
Well I don't know if they can run it like that
But ain't nobody else doing funny type rap
What's that?
Well I can tell a story about my morning
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
Like the 14 year old Topanga
Oh this shit like a joke to you?
I don't get it
Nah it ain't like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
Like, as a guy
So when I get up on the mic I ain't finna just lie
Real recognize real, right?
Yeah, I guess. So what you trying to do?
Five years from now, tell me bout the due
Well, I don't care about the money
Like, it's the respect that I'm wanting
Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats
Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate
I don't wanna leave the game the same
In a nutshell, what's your legacy?
Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap
With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap
Yet, the fans of rap started recognizing anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
That shit sound pretty damn complex
I guess, I wanna be the best
I just wanna do it my way
And turn the whole game sideways
And show people you ain't gotta be resigned to the highway
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
I ain't mad at that
Well thanks, man, that's my plan of my attack
Just let me in and I'mma rap the plaques
And I ain't about to win them back to back
I'm bout to win them like it's back to back to back to back to back
Til I stop rapping
You ain't even sold a damn album yet
True
That's a lot of talk from a wily vet
Let alone a young rook nigga
You misread me
Nah this ain't a book nigga
Well that's one of my flaws, I'm too competitive dawg
No, you just fucking repetitive dawg
I get it, you trying to be better than all, but you ain't shit until cheddars involved
I get that I gotta prove myself
No shit you ain't done shit
But think about that though
Only doing this a couple of years
One tape and I'm like this?
This shit is aight for your first shit
But you don't know if it's your worst shit
You don't think finding out would be worth it?
It might be, it might not
But I'mma put your ass to work, kid
Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really?
Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a together
What would you do for the for this song?
You want me to make a up right now?
Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself?
Alright, uh, okay
Man do the hook!
I'm bout to be professional
Homie, I'm professional
Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing?
Nigga, that shit is garbage man
Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it
But I'm not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
Don't y'all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?
Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there
Yeah, you know, I'm just way better when I get to think things through
Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing
Whatever man, you trying to smoke a blunt?
Right now?
Yeah
Sure

Maybe there's a singer with no ring around their little finger, no love
And If I lose my voice
If I have no choice but to go quiet
Won't you sing for me a melody into the night there
Well, if I die too young, if the wolf he comes
Fee-fi-fo-fum
If I die too young, oh, if the locust come
Well then, run, run, run
Free

If you ever hear that gunshot, you may think 'bout what you do but you don't got
Say a prayer, think of mother, I am a rock

If you ever hear that sound now
If the door gets kicked in here, they come now
Think of others, be their cover
I am what they're not

Pray for Paris
They cannot scare us
Or stop the music
You got a sweet voice, child
Why don't you use it?
If I die too young, if the gunmen come, I'm full of love

So release me, every piece of me, up above
(Up above)

Love my mama and my papa
Love my sister, can't stand the coppers up in their choppers
Oh, flying overhead, forty-nine dead
Singing, oh, my Lord, come carry me home
Oh, my Lord, come carry me home
I'm singing oh, my God, oh, my Lord
Oh, my God, oh, my Lord
Oh, my God, oh, my Lord
Oh, my Lord

And if I die too young for something I ain't done
Carry my name every day
Oh, I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry
Freddie Gray
But sleep easy like baby Jesus in a manger
Oh, sleep easy like little Jesus, beautiful stranger
Oh, beautiful stranger

If I die too young, let all that I've done be remembered
And I'll sleep easy like baby Jesus in his manger
And I'll sleep easy like little Jesus, safe from danger
Carry onward like some songbird, beautiful stranger
Carry onward like some songbird, beautiful stranger
Oh, beautiful stranger</td>

Of your father on the front lawn, with no shirt on
Ready to take the world on, beneath the West Texas sun
The year that you were born, the year that you are now
His wife behind the camera, his daughter and his baby boy
Got a glimmer in his eye, seems to say, this is what i'll miss after I die
And this is what i'll miss about being alive. My body, my girls, my boy, the sun

Now time's the undefeated, the heavyweight champ
Laughing in his face, as it dance like Sugar Ray
Us?d to be "c'mon c'mon" but now "no mas, no mas"

And this is a photograph, a window to the past
Of your mother in a skirt, in th? cool Kentucky dirt
Laughing in the garden (haha!) back where it all started
With a smile on her face, everything in its place
Got a glimmer in her eyes seems to say: this is what I'll miss about being alive
And this is what i'll miss after I die
This is a photograph, a window to the past
Of me on a front lawn, ready to take the world on
Beneath the Tennessee sun, inside the kingdom
Got a glimmer in my eye, seems to say</td>

As if we're used to the chagrin
We made our beds
And now we hate where these beds be
Took nothing at all to part this red sea
I'm a shackled child
Singing the good song of freedom
They've got no pride
They interrupt our grieving
Tear drops dropping
For the pain of the world
My best friend dies
When she was just a young girl
Left me here, to fend for myself
Now the pain never leaves
We just learn to cope
So when the devil needs hanging
Will you tie up the rope and shout pull
Let's put an end to this bull
Zen thing
How many years
Before we practice what we preach
How many tears
Before we truly clinch the peak
Only to find that
There is no honey on the moon
Official goon
With the unofficial croon

(2x)
I'm all things to all men
All of the women
All the children
Just say when
And I'll take you to my Tardis
Who's the hardest
Who's the hardest

16 bar cycles
Heart felt recital
From the wacky blacky man
They should have called me Michael
Look at the monster you make
Look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
'Cause it's each to his self
In these times that we live
Does god have a sense of humor
Then the joke's on us
'Cause we're chasing our tails
For how long
The tussle makes us how strong
Vintage poor people fun
If we could ease up
On these booze and fags
Then, just maybe
Life wouldn't seem so mad
Be a man my dad said
But what the hell he know
He lost his dreams
He lost his flow
And I don't wanna be alone
I'm born king
So where's my throne
I'm too intense
I'm too deep
I'm too nice for life
So what makes this place so nervous?

(4x)
I'm all things to all men
All of the women
All the children
Just say when
And I'll take you to my Tardis
Who's the hardest
Who's the hardest

Look at the monster you make
Look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
But you claim not
We're searching for Jesus
But I'll be damned
If I'll be crucified by ten thousand spies
Compulsive lies
They hate me
They love me
They hate me

'Cause I'm all things to all men, all of the women, all the children
Just say when and I'll take you to my Tardis

Lyrics by Gilmour / Samson

High Hopes&#213;&#226;&#202;&#215;&#184;&#232;&#202;&#199;Pink Floyd&#181;&#196;&#215;&#168;&#188;&#173;Division Bell&#192;&#239;&#181;&#196;&#181;&#218;11&#202;&#215;

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever

Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Breathe Reprise

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire

Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell</td>

Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who

Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

..I mean they're gonna kill ya. So like, if you give 'em a quick, sh.. short, sharp, shock, they don't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off light, 'cos I could've given him a thrashing, I only hit him once.  It's only a difference of right and wrong innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they, eh?

Down and out
It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about 

Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice

Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers,
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise
He's chained forever to a world that's departed
It's not enough, it's not enough
His blood has frozen &amp; curdled with fright
His knees have trembled &amp; given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth

His step has faltered
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river rolls
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder that words,
Of promises broken</td>

Things are not what they seem

Meek and obedient, you follow the leader
Down well-trodden corridors, into the valley of steel
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream 
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old</td>

Of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.

I'm nothing but a privileged peddler
And did you think I'd stay the night?
And did you think I'd love you forever?

And then you tell me, "Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more together
Boy, we can do much more together"

I gotta tell you girl, I want nothing less
Girl, I want nothing less

Boy, we made such a mess together

The more I understand about the human race
The less I comprehend about our purpose and place
And maybe if there was a clearer line the curiosity would satisfy.
Time based prophecies that kept me from living
In the moment I am struggling
To trust the divinity of all the guides
And what the hell they have planned for us.
I cry for the creatures who get left behind
But everything will change in a blink of an eye
And if you wish to survive
You will find the guide inside.
I go back and forth every single day
The clarity that comes to me in a choppy way
As the feelings
And the places
And the seasons change
The galaxies remain.
Energy fields cone the body in space.
The angels that are coming from a spiritual waste.
The hate that gets me distant from my spiritual pace.
Ten fold the manna when the planets are in place, in polar alignment.
We're on assignment.
Bodies on consignment.
Return them to the circus
And what is the purpose?
What is the purpose and would you believe it?
Would you believe it if you knew what you were for
And how you became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.
I am a miracle made up of particles
And in this existence
I'll stay persistent
And I'll make a difference
And I will have lived it.
Aloha, Aloha, Ke Akua, Ke Akua
Aloha, Aloha, Kuleana, Kuleana
Aloha, Aloha, Ke Akua, Ke Akua
Aloha, Aloha, Kuleana, Kuleana.
I am not a leader, just a creature.
Stick the peaches of my teacher when you follow where they lead.
All mysterious ways of nature and I am in to it.
Changing management.
And there are various ways to conquer this, monotonous, metropolis
My stubbornness is bottomless
My fear is this is talking shit
And I am wide awake and I am taking names.Do you speak to me like you speak to God?
All the love and understanding between the father and the son?
Do you believe in the perfectness of where you are?
He's my people he's my children it's the land that I would fight for.
I saw an ebonese telling me to patiently move the music medicine around the planet in a hurry.
Cuz there's no time to waste.
Got to wake up the people time to stand up and say
We know what we are for
And how we became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.
I am a miracle.
Made up of particles
And in this existence
I'll stay persistent
And I'll make a difference
And I will have lived it. ...
Aloha, Aloha, Ke Akua, Ke Akua
Aloha, Aloha, Kuleuna, Kuleana

Each day that I wake
I will praise, I will praise.
Each day that I wake
I give thanks, I give thanks.
Each day that I wake
I will praise, I will praise.
Each day that I wake
I give thanks, I give thanks.
And the day that I do wake up and transcend the holy makeup
I am capable.
I am powerful.
And the day that I do wake up and transcend the holy makeup
I am on my way to a different place I am powerful.
And the day that I do wake up and transcend the holy makeup
I am on my way to a different place</td>

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable
Than my own meandering experience, I will dispense this advice now

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind
You will never understand the power
And the beauty of your youth until they've faded
But trust me, in twenty years
You will look back at photos of yourself

And recall in a way you can't grasp now
How much possibility lay before you
And how fabulous you really looked
You are not as fat as you imagine

Don't worry about the future or worry that know that worrying
Is as affective as trying to solve an algebra equation
By chewing bubble gum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things
That never crossed your worried mind
The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday

Do one thing every day that scares you, sing
Don't be reckless with other peoples' hearts
Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours, floss
Don't waste your time on jealousy
Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind
The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself

Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults
If you succeed in doing this, tell me how
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements, stretch
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what to do with your life

The most interesting people
I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't
Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to knees, you'll miss them when they're gone

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the "Funky Chicken"
On your 75th wedding anniversary
Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
Or berate yourself either
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body, use it every way you can
Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it

It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own, dance
Even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room
Read the directions even if you don't follow them
Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Brother and sister together will make it through
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings, they are your best link to your past
And the people most likely to stick with you in the future
Understand that friends come and go
But a precious few, who should hold on

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle
For as the older you get, the more you need the people
You knew when you were young
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard
Live in northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft

Travel, accept certain inalienable truths
Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old
And when you do, you'll fanaticise that when you were young
Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble
And children respected their elders

Respect your elders, don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse
But you'll never know when either one will run out
Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're forty
It will look eighty-five
Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it

Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of
Wishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off
Painting over the ugly parts and recycling for more than it's worth
But trust me on the sunscreen

Brother and sister together will make it through, oh yeah
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Everybody's free, oh yeah, everybody's free, oh yeah, oh, to feel good</td>

It was almost impossible because it was, the dream was so big that I didn't see any chance, because I was living in a little town. I was studying and when I finally broke away from school and became a musician, I thought, "Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance," because all I really wanted to do is music, and not only play music, but compose music.

At that time, in Germany, in '69-'70, they had already discotheques. So I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes. I think I had about seven, eight songs. I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two years to survive in the beginning.

I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s, and then have a sound of the future, and then I thought, "Wait a second, I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer, which is the sound of the future?"

And I didn't have any idea what to do, but I knew I needed a click so we put the click on the 24-track which then was synced to the Moog modular. I knew that could be a sound of the future but I didn't realize how much the impact would be.

My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.

Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct, you can do whatever you want, so nobody told me what to do, and there was no preconception of what to do.</td>

Can only manage to say something similar.

Throw me in the dirt pit
Don't think about the choices that you make
Throw me in the water
Don't think about the splash I will create
Leave me at the altar
Knowing all the things you just escaped

Push me out to sea
On the little boat that you made out
Of the evergreen
That you helped your father cut away
And leave me on the tracks
To wait until the morning train arrives
Don't you dare look back
Walk away, catch up on the sunrise

This is torturous
Electricity between both of us
And this is dangerous
Cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts

I hate you

So leave me in the cold
Wait until the snow covers me up
So I cannot move
So I'm just embedded in the frost
And leave me in the rain
Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
Wipe away your tear stains
Thought you said you didn't feel pain

Well this is torturous
Electricity between both of us
And this is dangerous
Cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts
I want you so much
But I hate your guts

Well this is torturous
Electricity between both of us

Were hidden under the grid
Young and naive, I never believed
That love could be so well hid
With regret, I'm willing to bet
And say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive
And harder to forget

It gets under your shirt
Like a dagger at work
The first cut is the deepest
But the rest still flipping hurt
You build your heart of plastic
Get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up?
When you're coked up
And can't remember the reason why you broke up?
You call her in the morning
When you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road

'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you wanna be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies, they flutter by and leave us on our arses

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
'Cause all I wanna do is try to make a connection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

Oh, I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
And I thought I was close but under further inspection

I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take

One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
But no one gives us any time anymore

He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it then you ran off
I've got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?

Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?

Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

He sees right through me it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he will fall

One thousand lonely stars, hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't want to sing anymore

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?

I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long

And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while

Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you,
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very, very
Mad world, mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me, what's my lesson?

All together, separately

No matter where they wander
From post to in between,
From here to over yonder,
There's no place for them to land
Lonely are the free

The silent are the strong
Not so much as a whisper
Tells you anything is wrong

You've known all along,

But you can't help but listen
And now the moment's gone.

It keeps you hanging on
Until the stillness signaling
The breaking of the dawn,
Is shattered by the sirens
Singing sacrificial songs

The silent are the strong.

That's all they used to see
A violent shadow passing 'cross
The sun so fleetingly
That if you have to ask you miss it
Anyway you see
Lonely are the free

The minor fall and the major lift

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before, I knew you

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch

And Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?

And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh could I be the sky on the fourth of July?

"Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die"

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now where am I? My fading supply

"Did you get enough love, my little dove
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles"

The hospital asked should the body be cast
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

"Shall we look at the moon, my little loon
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light

Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die"

We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die

We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die</td>

That you've been gone

She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"

I get along but the trips always feel so long

And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever

Please come back home

Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while

Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so

That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?

Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Hold your memory for a moment with a blind hand
Write some stories for tomorrow
From the bottle of amnesia
Find instructions, to salvation, to oblivion, supreme

Someday miraculous spread will forgive every cowardly thing that you've done

And all their school books and their running shoes
Washing them clean in the dirty steel sink

Helps me pass the time
Concentrates my mind
Helps me to sleep

Keep making beds, keep the cat fed
Open the windows, let the air in
Keep the house clean, keep the routine
Paintings they made still stuck to the fridge

Keep cleaning, keep ironing
Cooking their meals on the stainless steel hob
Keep washing, keep scrubbing
Long until the dark comes to bruise the sky
Deep in the debt to night

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Helps me to sleep

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Helps me to sleep

The most beautiful morning forever
Like the ones from far off, far off away
With the hum of the bees in the jasmine sway

Try to let go
Don't ever let go
Try to let go
Don't ever</td>

Yes, I saw you were blind and I knew I had won

So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you if you'd only care

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind and that I knew when
My heart was blinded by you

I've kissed your lips and held your head
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

You have been the one for me

You can't break my spirit, it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be

I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you

I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover

You have been the one
You have been the one for me

In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bear my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

You have been the one for me

Goodbye my lover

Cruel bindings.

Pulling poor blankets over
Our sailors

I'm sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the tv
Tower, I want roses in
My garden bower; dig? 
Royal babies, rubies
Must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant that's plowed.

They are waiting to take us into
The severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest you've
Brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven's
Claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until it's other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law.

I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends
To the giant family.</td>

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
"Fools," said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence"</td>

For my love is yell of giving and hold on

And the bright emptiness
In a room full of it
Is a cruel mistress
Whoa oh!

I feel this unrest
That nests all hollowness
For I have nowhere to go and I'm cold

And I feel so lonely yeah...
There's a better place than this
Emptiness

And I'm so lonely yeah...
There's a better place than this
Emptiness, yeah!

Tune mere jaana
Kabhi nahi jaana
Ishq mera, dard mera, haaye!

Tune mere jaana
Kabhi nahi jaana
Ishq mera, dard mera

Aashiq tera
Bhid me khoya rehta hai
Jaane jahaan
Poocho to itna kehta hai

That I feel so lonely yeah...
There's a better place than this
Emptiness

And I'm so lonely yeah
There's a better place than this
Emptiness, yeah!</td>

Title: Fix You
Album: X &amp; Y

---------------
---------------
---------------

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse?

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worst?

Lights will guide you home,
And ignite your bones,
And I will try to fix you,

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

All of my wasted dreams on

Hear the truth they're telling
A world begins where the road ends
Watch me leave it all behind

Once I built an ivory tower
So I could worship from above
When I climb down to be set free
She took me in again

There?s a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
And I, I see her inner charm
She just throws it back at me

Once I dug an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me
And took her rules back again

There?s a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world

Oh, there?s a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people

She is comfort by my side
When I try to understand
She just opens up her hands

There?s a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world

Once I stood to lose her
When I saw what I had done

Bowed down and threw away the hours
Of her garden and her sun

So I tried to warn her
I turned to see her weep
Forty days and forty nights
And it's still coming down on me

There?s a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people

You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back</td>

Listened to the Sunday actors

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

Schooled on the city sidewalks
Coldness at every turn
Knew I had to find the exits
I never, ever would return
Scoffed at the prophet's omens
That said I would live to learn

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

Going unaided toward the west coast
Stopped in the sleepy town
Left my change and walked out
I didn't even turn around
What they were getting next to
Was that old familiar sound

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

In a hotel room in Amsterdam
On a wild and windy August night
As a cloud passed over a cold moon
My heart was seized with terror and fright
Seeping up through the floorboards
Coming in through the walls
Coming in through the doorway
Ringing up and down the halls

That you can't get away from it
No you can't get away
No you can't get away from it
No you can't get away

No you can't get away
No you can't get away
No you can't get away...

Like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught on the crossfire
Of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend,
You martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon,
You cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night,
And exposed to the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome
With random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper,
You prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and
I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child,
You winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion,
and shine!</td>

High Hopes

Music by Gilmour  

Lyrics by Gilmour / Samson 

&#184;&#232;&#180;&#202;&#214;&#198;&#215;&#247;:&#200;&#203;&#214;&#174;&#179;&#245;

High Hopes&#213;&#226;&#202;&#215;&#184;&#232;&#202;&#199;Pink Floyd&#181;&#196;&#215;&#168;&#188;&#173;Division Bell&#192;&#239;&#181;&#196;&#181;&#218;11&#202;&#215;

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever

I'll sit in the corner

I think I should speak now ( why won't you talk to me )
I can't seem to speak now ( you never talk to me )

I feel like I'm drowning ( what are you feeling )
I'm feeling weak now ( why won't you talk to me )
But I can't show my weakness ( you never talk to me )

I sometimes wonder ( what are you thinking )
Where do we go from here ( what are you feeling )

It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

Why won't you talk to me [ I feel like I'm drowning ]
You never talk to me [ You know I can't breathe now]
What are you thinking [ I feel like I'm drowning ]
What are you feeling [ were going nowhere ]
Why won't you talk to me
You never talk to me
What are you thinking
Where do we go from here

I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all

I've got a little black book with my poems in
I've got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in

I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from

I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation

And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home

I've got the obligatory  perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt

I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains

I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to

Ooooh babe when I pick up the phone
(Spoken) Surprise, surprise, surprise... (from Gomer Pyle show)
There's still nobody home

I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I've got fading roots

(Spoken) Where the hell are you?
Over 47 german planes were destroyed with the loss of only 15 of our own aircraft.
Where the hell are you Simon?

I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone

Waiting for the worms to come

Outside Brixton Town hall where we're going to be

Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows and kick in their doors

Waiting for the final solution to strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms
Waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens

Waiting for the queers and the coons
And the Reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms

Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms

Would you like to send our colored cousins
Home again, my friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms

The worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station
We'll be moving along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road
[Incomprehensible] Abbot's road [Incomprehensible]
To three we'll be moving along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall bridge
Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge
We're in Westminster area

I'm waiting for the call, the hand on the chest
I'm ready for the fight, and fate

The sound of iron shocks is stuck in my head,
The thunder of the drums dictates

The rhythm of the falls, the number of deaths
The rising of the heights, ahead

From the dawn of time to the end of days
I will have to run, away
I want to feel the pain and the bitter taste
Of the blood on my lips, again

This steady burst of snow is burning my hands,
I'm frozen to the bones, I am
A million mile from home, I'm walking away
I can't remind your eyes, your face</td>

So overdued I went to the company store
And the clerk there said that they had just been invaded
So I set sail in a teardrop and escaped beneath the doorsill

'Cause I see my people trying to drown the sun
In weekends of whiskey sours
'Cause how many times can you wake up in this comic book
And plant flowers?

I adore you
And if a day passes by without seeing you
I forget you
How come this time I drew you
The Longing moves the nostalgia in my heart
The night gets longer and the day passes backwards
Oh my fragile heart
The separation is killing me
I have no solution (hal)
I have no solution
My heart doesn't love once
My heart doesn't long for you once either</td>

Come in the likeness in the image of God.
Because, you can be like that.
With all that humbleness, and all that respect.
All of the power invested in me
Be it hard to love my enemies.
All of the black bags over the heads of the dead and dying.
The more I understand about the human race
The less I comprehend about our purpose and place
And maybe if there was a clearer line the curiosity would satisfy.
Time based prophecies that kept me from living
In the moment I am struggling
To trust the divinity of all the guides
And what the hell they have planned for us.
I cry for the creatures who get left behind
But everything will change in a blink of an eye
And if you wish to survive
You will find the guide inside.
I go back and forth every single day
The clarity that comes to me in a choppy way
As the feelings
And the places
And the seasons change
The galaxies remain.
Energy fields cone the body in space.
The angels that are coming from a spiritual waste.
The hate that gets me distant from my spiritual pace.
Ten fold the manna when the planets are in place, in polar alignment.
We're on assignment.
Bodies on consignment.
Return them to the circus
And what is the purpose?
What is the purpose and would you believe it?
Would you believe it if you knew what you were for
And how you became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.
I am a miracle made up of particles
And in this existence
I'll stay persistent
And I'll make a difference
And I will have lived it.

I am not a leader, just a creature.
Stick the peaches of my teacher when you follow where they lead.
All mysterious ways of nature and I am in to it.
Changing management.
And there are various ways to conquer this, monotonous, metropolis
My stubbornness is bottomless
My fear is this is talking shit
And I am wide awake and I am taking names.Do you speak to me like you speak to God?
All the love and understanding between the father and the son?
Do you believe in the perfectness of where you are?
He's my people he's my children it's the land that I would fight for.
I saw an ebonese telling me to patiently move the music medicine around the planet in a hurry.
Cuz there's no time to waste.
Got to wake up the people time to stand up and say
We know what we are for
And how we became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.
I am a miracle.
Made up of particles
And in this existence
I'll stay persistent
And I'll make a difference

Dido - White Flag
lrc by the evil diva

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
I'll tell you that.
But if I didn't say it,
well I'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and
destruction to come back again
And I caused but nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
then I'm sure that that makes sense

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was then
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....
Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

You and I we head back East
To find a town where we can live
Even in the half light
We can see that something's gotta give

When we watched the markets crash
The promises we made were torn
Then my parents sent for me
From out West where I was born

Some people say they've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost
Pay the cost for what we've lost

Now that you have left me here
I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life

Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child
Pray to God I won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild

Though we knew this day would come
Still it took us by surprise
In this town where I was born
I now see through a dead man's eyes

One day they will see it's long gone
One day they will see it's long gone

One day they will see it's long gone

Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
And what was that line you said

Title: A Whiter Shade Of Pale

-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------

We skipped the light Fandango

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor

I was feeling kind of seasick

But the crowd called out for more

The room was humming harder

As the ceiling flew away

When we called out for another drink

The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later

As the Miller told his tale

That her face, at first just ghostly

Turned a whiter shade of pale

------ organ solo ------

She said there is no reason

And the truth is plain to see

But I wandered through my playing cards

And would not let her be

One of sixteen vestal virgins

Who were leaving for the coast

And although my eyes were open

They might just as well've been closed

And so it was that later

As the Miller told his tale

That her face, at first just ghostly

Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was.... (fade)

And I know that I am

What if I'd been born fifty years before you
In a house on the street where you live?
Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike
Would I know?

And in a wide sea of eyes

I see one pair that I recognize
And I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest

I love you more than I have
Ever found a way to say to you

Next door, there's an old man who lived to his 90's
And one day, passed away in his sleep
And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way
To tell you that I know we belong

A kiss that can't renew

Tip toe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace
ooh

There's no where left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die

Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew

Live in the light of certain
South
Cruel bindings.
The servants have the power
Dog-men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over
Our sailors

I'm sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the tv
Tower, I want roses in
My garden bower; dig? 
Royal babies, rubies
Must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant that's plowed.

They are waiting to take us into
The severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest you've
Brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven's
Claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until it's other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law.

I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends
To the giant family.</td>

As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
Would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well have been closed

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And the time spent alone

But there is really nothing
Nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten
Life can always start off anew

The models will have children
We'll get a divorce
We'll find some more models
Everything must run its course
We'll choke on our vomit

Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

[Verse 2]
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the kazachok, he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the Queen, he was no wheeler-dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son

[Chorus]
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on

[Bridge]
But when his drinking, and lusting and his hunger for power
Became known to more and more people
The demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and louder

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
"This man's just gotta go," declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us," they kept demanding
And he really came

[Chorus]
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said, "I feel fine"
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, lover of the Russian Queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra-Ra-Rasputin, Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him 'til he was dead

Title: Fix You
Album: X &amp; Y

---------------
---------------
---------------

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse?

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worst?

Lights will guide you home,
And ignite your bones,
And I will try to fix you,

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

You've crossed the finish line
Won the race but lost your mind
Was it worth it after all

I need you here with me
Cause love is all we need
Just take a hold of the hand that breaks the fall

Well I know what I've been told
Gotta break free to break the mold
But I can't do this all on my own

I know that I'm no Superman

You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back</td>

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

=====================================

Here I am
Lost in the light of the moon that comes thru my window
Bathed in blue
The walls of my memories divides the thorns from the roses
it's you and the roses

Touch me and I will follow
In your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go
I will find my way, when I see your eyes
Now I'm living
In your afterglow

Here I am
Lost in the ashes of time
But who wants tomorrow
In between
The longing to hold you again

I'm caught in your shadow
I'm losing control
My mind drifts away
We only have today

Touch me and I wil follow
In your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go
I will find my way, I will sacrifice
Til the blinding day, when I see your eyes
Now I'm Living
In Your Afterglow
(in your afterglow)

And the veils are gone
As I let you go
As I let you go

Touch me and I wil follow
In your afterglow
Heal me from all this sorrow
As I let you go
I will find my way, I will sacrifice
Now I'm living
In your afterglow

Bathed in blue
The walls of my memories divides the thorns from the roses
It's you who is closing</td>

If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they try to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(They said farewell)

But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(A jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

I'd like to make myself believe

It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

I'm bringin' light
Like Thomas funky Edison
Been in the desert for forty seven days
Purple Haze
The poison that I tasted never changed
Turn up the woofers so I can feel the beat
Vibrate my belly like a bomb in harmony
Summer heat
My back is sticking to me to the seat
Bare feet
Tank top and shorts is all ya need
Summer breeze
I'm feelin' kinda fine
I'm rollin with my shorty all the time
Wind and grind lovely shake your behind
Cinnamon skin be bringing sin to my mind
But whether or not the weather's hot
Or the weather's cold
I'm wrapping her like a blanket with my whole soul
So that she can feel me
Like Coca Cola I'm the woo-o-oh oh the sweet thing
My girl lollipop she growing mad crops
She rollin' herbs everyday
At about 4 o' clock
Tick tock
Strike the hammer while the Iron's hot
Ooh girl watcha got cooking in the pot

See Mary Mary quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
Hydrophonic ultra supersonic
Or does it grow naturally slow?

Ganja babe my sweet ganja babe
I love tha way ya love me and the way ya misbehavin'
Ganja babe my sweet ganja babe
Come wake body-ody take my mind away

Everybody get down and do the boogaloo
Just like the cover of I want you
Yoo hooo look watcha gonna do
Watcha gonna do when the rent comes due
Round up the posse and call up the crew
5 Bucks at the door and ya bring ya own booze
Call ya neighbor 'cause they can come too
Be sure and bring ya records 'cause I only got a few
So baa baa black sheep have you any wool
Yes sir, yes sir a nickle bagful
One for my partner one for my crew
Some for my ganja baby she needs to
'Cause just like me they want to be cool

Scarborough Fair
Simon and Garfunkel
Are you going to Scarborough fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needlework
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to find me an acre of land 
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strand
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

I can feel you, though
Wake me from this dreamin'

[Verse 2]
Flip the switch
You're keepin&#8217; me in the dark
My vision&#8217;s clear, I see ya left a mark
I'm a force and I won&#8217;t let you drag me down
Down...
If you go then I'm not goin' with you now
[Chorus]
Don't look back
Nothin&#8217; left to see
Just leave the shadows in the past
If I let it go
Can I shake this feelin'?
Oh oh oh
Just like that
Tomorrow's one day that I'm never getting back
I can feel you, though
Wake me from this dreamin'

[Outro]
Wake me from this dreamin'</td>

Lay down in a grave go back to sleep

Can't convince myself

To let go

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying

Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon

How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love

And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way
To tell you that I know we belong
That I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest</td>

Were hidden under the grid
Young and naive, I never believed
That love could be so well hid
With regret, I'm willing to bet
And say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive
And harder to forget

It gets under your shirt
Like a dagger at work
The first cut is the deepest
But the rest still flipping hurt
You build your heart of plastic
Get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up?
When you're coked up
And can't remember the reason why you broke up?
You call her in the morning
When you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road

'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you wanna be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies, they flutter by and leave us on our arses

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
'Cause all I wanna do is try to make a connection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

Oh, I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
And I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

It seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Well it seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes
Put your sunglasses on

In what you see?
Motionless wheel
Nothing is real

Wasting my time
In the waiting line
Do you believe
In what you see?

Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me

Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me

Everyone's saying different things to me

Everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can

And everyone's taking everything they can
Everything they can
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me

Different things to me
Different things to me
Different things to me

Leave your things behind
'Cause it's all going off without you
Excuse me, too busy
You're writing your tragedy
These mishaps you bubble wrap
When you've no idea what you're like

So let go, so let go, jump in

So let go, yeah let go, just get in

'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown

It gains the more it gives
And then it rises with the fall
So hand me that remote
Can't you see that all that stuff's a sideshow?
Such boundless pleasure
We've no time for later now
You can't await your own arrival
You've twenty seconds to comply

You could say anything

Your voice is everything
We owe it to love
And it all depends on you

So listen up - this sun hasn't set
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling
Just hear me out - i'm not over you yet
It's love on the line can you handle it

So how do i do normal
The smile i fake - the permanent wave of
Cue cards and fix it kits
Can't you tell - i'm not myself

I'm a slow motion accident
Lost in coffee rings - and fingerprints
I don't - wanna feel - anything

But i do
And it all comes back to you

So listen up - this sun hasn't set

Just hear me out - i'm not over you yet
(It's love on the line can you handle it?)

So listen up
Look at me straight
Just hear me out
Don't make me wait
I'm not myself
I can't take this
Love's on the line
Is that your final answer

I join the queue on your answerphone
And all i am - is holding breath
Just pick up i know you're there......

White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me

Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

[Verse 3]
How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed?
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath

Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast 

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me, a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Stay away
Look out

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman

You can't remember where it was
had this dream stopped?

Awake

Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see.

A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us.
Choose they croon the Ancient Ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances.</td>

All together, separately

That's how it's s'posed to be
No matter where they wander
From post to in between,
From here to over yonder,
There's no place for them to land
Lonely are the free

The silent are the strong
Not so much as a whisper
Tells you anything is wrong

You've known all along,

But you can't help but listen
And now the moment's gone.

It keeps you hanging on
Until the stillness signaling
The breaking of the dawn,
Is shattered by the sirens
Singing sacrificial songs

The silent are the strong.

That's all they used to see
A violent shadow passing 'cross
The sun so fleetingly
That if you have to ask you miss it
Anyway you see
Lonely are the free
Lonely are the free</td>

[Verse 1: Karen Carpenter]
Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here/near
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

[Chorus]
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

[Verse 2]
Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

[Chorus]
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world</td>

If I die too young, if the gunmen come, I'm full of love

So release me, every piece of me, up above

There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadow's taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last

To be a rock and not to roll

Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one</td>

And I don't know what to do

Yes, she caught my eye
As we walked on by.
She could see from my face that I
was
Flying high.
And I don't think that I'll see her

again
But we shared a moment that will
last 'til the end.

on her face
When she thought up that I should
be with you.
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you.</td>

You never did notice, but you still hide away

Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather

Whiplash girlchild in the dark

Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him 

Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Downy sins of streetlight fancies

Chase the costumes she shall wear

Ermine furs adorn the imperious

Severin, Severin awaits you there

I am tired, I am weary

I could sleep for a thousand years

A thousand dreams that would awake me 

Different colors made of tears

Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather

Shiny leather in the dark

Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you 

Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Severin, Severin, speak so slightly

Severin, down on your bended knee

Taste the whip, in love not given lightly 

Taste the whip, now plead for me

I am tired, I am weary

I could sleep for a thousand years

A thousand dreams that would awake me 

Different colors made of tears

Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather 

Whiplash girlchild in the dark 

Severin, your servant comes in bells, please don't forsake him 

Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Fight over life, over blood, over air and light
Over love, over sun, over another

And I guess I just dont know

I have made very big decision
Im goin to try to nullify my life

All you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess I just dont know
And I guess I just dont know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that Id sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
I put on a sailors suit and cap

Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils in this town
And of himself and those around
Oh, and I guess I just dont know
Oh, and I guess I just dont know

Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, its my wife and its my life
Because a mainer to my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then Im better off than dead

When the smack begins to flow
Then I really dont care anymore
About all the jim-jims in this town
And everybody putting everybody else down
And all of the politicians makin crazy sounds
All the dead bodies piled up in mounds, yeah

Wow, that heroin is in my blood
And the blood is in my head
Yeah, the gods good as dead
Ooohhh, God that Im not aware

had this dream stopped?

Awake

Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see.

A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us.
Choose they croon the Ancient Ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances.</td>

Did you have a good world when you died?

Enough to base a movie on?.

Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas

High Hopes

Music by Gilmour  

Lyrics by Gilmour / Samson 

&#184;&#232;&#180;&#202;&#214;&#198;&#215;&#247;:&#200;&#203;&#214;&#174;&#179;&#245;

High Hopes&#213;&#226;&#202;&#215;&#184;&#232;&#202;&#199;Pink Floyd&#181;&#196;&#215;&#168;&#188;&#173;Division Bell&#192;&#239;&#181;&#196;&#181;&#218;11&#202;&#215;

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever

Where were you when I was burned and broken
While the days slipped by from my window watching
Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted

Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life

I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight...into the shining sun</td>

Blown on the steel breeze.

Come on you stranger, you legend,

You cried for the moon.

And exposed to the light.

With random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.

Come on you painter, you piper,
You prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and
I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.

You winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion,

Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient, you follow the leader
Down well-trodden corridors, into the valley of steel
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream 
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old</td>

Milo....
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it&#161;&#175;s like 
to be hated
To be faded 
to telling only lies
As my conscious seems to be
But my dreams they aren&#161;&#175;t as empty
I have hours, only lonely
As my conscious seems to be
My love is vengeance
I have hours, only lonely
That&#161;&#175;s never free
My love is vengeance
No one knows what its like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
and I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain woe
Can show through

Where is my milo.....
Where is my love.....
No one knows what its like
To be mistreated
to be defeated
Behind blue eyes
And no one know how to say
That they&#161;&#175;re sorry
and don&#161;&#175;t worry

No one knows what it&#161;&#175;s like

To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
I wish it was
all than easy
I wish I wish
I wish I wish
I wish it was
all than easy
where is my milo&#163;&#191;.....
Where is my love&#163;&#191;.....

Hotel California

On a dark desert highway,
cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas,
rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance,
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
&#8217;this could be heaven or this could be hell&#8217;
Then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to The Hotel California
Such a lovely place.. such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at The Hotel California
Any time of year.. any time of year,
you can find it here
Her mind is tiffany-twisted,
she got the mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,
that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard,
sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember,
some dance to forget
So I called up the captain,
&#8217;please bring me my wine&#8217;
He said, &#8217;we haven&#8217;t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine&#8217;
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say-ay...
Welcome to The Hotel California
Such a lovely place.. such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin&#8217; it up at The Hotel California
What a nice surprise!.. what a nice surprise!,
bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said &#8217;we are all just prisoners here, of our own device&#8217;
And in the master&#8217;s chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can&#8217;t kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
&#8217;relax,&#8217; said the night man,
We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like,
But you can never leave!

To find a town where we can live
Even in the half light

When we watched the markets crash
The promises we made were torn
Then my parents sent for me
From out West where I was born

Some people say they've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost
Pay the cost for what we've lost

Now that you have left me here
I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life

Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child
Pray to God I won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild

Though we knew this day would come
Still it took us by surprise
In this town where I was born
I now see through a dead man's eyes

One day they will see it's long gone
One day they will see it's long gone

You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know

Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City's the place where
They said, "Hey babe
Take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey Joe
Take a walk on the wild side"

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should've seen 'em go, go, go
They said, "Hey sugar
Take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey babe
Take a walk on the wild side"
All right, huh

Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would have helped that bash
She said, "Hey babe
Take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey honey
Take a walk on the wild side"

And the colored girls say:
"Doo do doo do doo do do doo, ..."</td>

But I'll stay fitted, new era committed

Do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast, it's moving really fast

It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)

I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, a microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' on my mind every second with my fist

Everybody wanna run, wanna run
Everybody wanna hide from the gun, from the gun
You can take a ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take that edge off that knife, no, sir

And now you want your money back, money back
But you're denied 'cause your brains fried from the sack
And there ain't nothing I can do
'Cause life is a lesson; you learn it when you're through

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

Title: Smoke On The Water







We all came out to montreux

On the lake geneva shoreline

To make records with a mobile

We didn&#8217;t have much time

Frank zappa and the mothers

Were at the best place around

But some stupid with a flare gun

Burned the place to the ground



Smoke on the water

fire in the sky



Smoke on the water





They burned down the gambling house

It died with an awful sound

Funky claude was running in and out

Pulling kids out the ground

When it all was over

We had to find another place

But swiss time was running out

It seemed that we would lose the race



Smoke on the water

fire in the sky



Smoke on the water





We ended up at the grand hotel

It was empty cold and bare

But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside

Making our music there

With a few red lights and a few old beds

We make a place to sweat

No matter what we get out of this

I know

I know we&#8217;ll never forget

Smoke on the water

fire in the sky



Smoke on the water

Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to The Gallow's Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Motherfuckers!
Running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not so easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there is never an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell God be with you
If there's a God then why has he let me die?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away

Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
Please don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth

So when you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion

Oh, hallowed be thy name
Oh, hallowed be thy
Name

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name

Load up on guns and bring your friends 

It's fun to lose and to pretend 

She's over bored and self assured 

Oh no, I know a dirty word 

Hello, hello, hello, how low?

Hello, hello, hello, how low?

Here we are now, entertain us

I feel stupid and contagious

A mulatto 

An albino 

A mosquito

Yay!

I'm worse at what I do best 

And for this gift I feel blessed

Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile

I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb</td>

I think I should speak now ( why won't you talk to me )

I sometimes wonder ( what are you thinking )
Where do we go from here ( what are you feeling )

It doesn't have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

Why won't you talk to me [ I feel like I'm drowning ]
You never talk to me [ You know I can't breathe now]
What are you thinking [ I feel like I'm drowning ]
What are you feeling [ were going nowhere ]
Why won't you talk to me
You never talk to me
What are you thinking

The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore

Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight

The blind men shout "Let the creatures out!
We'll show the unbelievers
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime-time Belsen feast... yeah!"

Cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine
And feed it with our babies

Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain

The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

The body bags and little rags
Of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain
To put the finger right on you

As the madmen play on words
And make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions
To make a better kind of gun

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore

[Verse 1: Bob Marley]
Preacher man, don't tell me
Heaven is under the earth
I know you don't know
What life is really worth

It's not all that glitters is gold
'Alf the story has never been told
So now you see the light, eh
Stand up for your rights, come on

[Verse 2: Bob Marley]
Most people think
Great God will come from the skies
Take away everything
And make everybody feel high

But if you know what life is worth
You will look for yours on earth
And now you see the light
You stand up for your rights, Jah

[Hook: Bob Marley &amp; Damian Marley]
Get up, stand up
(Jah, Jah)
Stand up for your rights
(Oh, hoo)
Get up, stand up
Get up, stand up)
Don't give up the fight

[Verse 3: Bob Marley]
We sick an' tired of-a your ism-schism game
Dyin' 'n' goin' to Heaven in a Jesus' name, Lord
We know when we understand
Almighty God is a living man

You can fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
So now we see the light
(What you gonna do?)
We gonna stand up for our rights
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Madman drummers bummers

His way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder

Some silicone sister
With her manager mister
Told me I've got what it takes
She said
"I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong
Play the song with the funky break"
And go-kart Mozart
Was checking out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early Pearly
Came by in his curly wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride

Asked me if I needed a ride
'Cause she was blinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light

She got down but she never got tight
She's gonna make it to the night
She's gonna make it through the night

But mama, that's where the fun is
But mama, that's where the fun is
Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is

Some brimstone baritone
Anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone
Hit it in its funny bone
That's where they expect it least"
And some new mown chaperone
Was standing in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone
Was messing with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance

The calliope crashed to the ground
'Cause she was blinded by the light

She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

Oh lord I held my breath
Dead they don't come back
Dead they don't come back
Dead they don't, dead they don't, dead they don't come back

And on my way to school
I passed that old graveyard
Life is mighty lonely
And life is mighty hard
Dead they don't wake up
Dead they don't wake up
Dead they don't, dead they don't, dead they don't wake up

Oh I am on a ride
Measure the distance in time

I can see your teardrops
Behind that black black veil
Made me hope for heaven
And me scared for hell
Dead they all will sleep
Dead they all will sleep

Dead they all, the dead they all, the dead they all will sleep

And from time to time
I think about my grave
When I'm gonna have one
And what's it gonna say
It feels good to rest
It's been a long long day
It's been a long, it's been a long, it's been a long long day

Oh I am on a ride
Measure the distance in time
And as sure as I was born
I will die

And on my way back home
Stopped at your tombstone
Said a prayer for you
I was tired and alone
Said lord I miss my friend
Who's underneath my feet
May her soul, oh may her soul, oh may her soul rest in peace</td>

Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain

And some you just can't tell
And some they will and some they won't
With some it's just as well

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' "Hey, Diddle Diddle" with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
Then I knowed love was here to stay

When she told me to
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Just gimme a kiss!

Like this
Ooh
Uh

School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this

Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there,
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel.
In the great magnetic field.
When he traveled time,
For the future of mankind.

Nobody wants him,
He just stares at the world.

Planning his vengeance,
That he will soon unfold.

Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron man lives again!</td>

His leather chair waits at the bank
And Seargent Dow Jones, twenty-seven years old
Commanding his very own tank
But Lather still finds it a nice thing to do
To lie about nude in the sand
Drawing pictures of mountains that look like bumps
And thrashing the air with his hands

But wait, oh Lather's productive you know
He produces the finest of sound
Putting drumsticks on either side of his nose
Snorting the best licks in town
But that's all over...

Lather was thirty years old today
And Lather came foam from his tongue
He looked at me eyes wide and plainly said
Is it true that I'm no longer young?
And the children call him famous
What the old men call insane
And sometimes he's so nameless
That he hardly knows which game to play...
Which words to say...
And I should have told him, "No, you're not old."
And I should have let him go on...smiling...babywide</td>

Album: Highway to Hell

Living easy
living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing
leave me be
Taking everything in my stride
Don't need reason
don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing i would rather do
Going down
party time
My friends are gonna be there too
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
No stop signs
speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me round
Hey satan
payed my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey momma
look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
(don't stop me)
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
And i'm going down
all the way down
I'm on the highway to hell

No love for myself and no love for another
Searching to find a love upon a higher level
Finding nothing but questions and devils

Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long I'm glad to be back [I bet you know I'm...]
Yes, I'm let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I've been looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild
CHORUS:
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
(Well) I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Back in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang
With a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

Even when she was giving head
She says, "Hey babe

They said, "Hey babe

I said, "Hey Joe

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should've seen 'em go, go, go
They said, "Hey sugar

I said, "Hey babe

All right, huh

Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would have helped that bash

Of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.

Come on you miner for truth and delusion,

Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hearable

Without it you make it
Allow me to make this
Child, like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child and beast
Every cloud you see
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion heprovides
with me as a guide
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing, remember
(that it's all in your head)

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

King of the road

Trailer for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes

But two hours of pushin' broom
Buys an eight by twelve four bit room
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road</td>

I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed

And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

Yes, she caught my eye
As we walked on by.
She could see from my face that I
was
Flying high.
And I don't think that I'll see her

again
But we shared a moment that will
last 'til the end.

on her face
When she thought up that I should
be with you.
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you.</td>

Sit and listen, sit and listen

She always belonged to someone else

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door

It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah

Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls,

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home</td>

Dido - White Flag
lrc by the evil diva

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
I'll tell you that.
But if I didn't say it,
well I'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and
destruction to come back again
And I caused but nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
then I'm sure that that makes sense

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was then
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....
Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

And all I see is you

And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue

Title: Fix You
Album: X &amp; Y

---------------
---------------
---------------

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse?

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worst?

Lights will guide you home,
And ignite your bones,
And I will try to fix you,

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Spent the summer staring out the window
The wind, it takes you where it wants to go

First they built the road, then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around and around
And all we see are kids in buses longing to be free

Wasted hours before we knew
Where to go and what to do
Wasted hours that you made new
And turned into a life that we can live

Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
And what was that line you said
(Something about how our time it owns us now)

Wishing you were anywhere but here
You watch the life you're living disappear
And now I see, we're still kids in buses longing to be free

Wasted hours before we knew
Where to go and what to do
Wasted hours that you made new
And turned into a life that we can live

A life that we can live
A life that we can live

Down the road, we've down the road
We've down the road, we've down the road, we've

A life that we can live
A life that we can live

Down the road, we've down the road
We've down the road, we've down the road, we've

Down the road, we've down the road
We've down the road, we've down the road
We've down the road, we've</td>

It&#8217;s just so cold outside
I&#8217;m fragile and tired
oh, I just want a night to myself
and though my step count is pathetic
I&#8217;m just not feeling energetic
and you might think i&#8217;ll be bummed that I didn&#8217;t go
try tell me while I&#8217;m in the bath and drinking alone

everyone has gone to a party
and I didn&#8217;t want to go
I&#8217;m just gonna eat and watch netflix
I&#8217;m antisocial and lazy I know

I can&#8217;t tell if i am self caring
or is this part of an issue that&#8217;s deep

Well this world is a cold one
But it takes one to know one
And God only knows what you are

Just some Portland white trash
You confronted your sorrow
Like there was no tomorrow
While the rest of the world only laughed

Triple axel on high
A delightful disaster
You jumped farther and faster
You were always so full of surprises

Are your laces untied?
What&#8217;s the frown on your face for?
And just what are the skates for now?
Tell me which is your good side?

Are you lonely at night?
Do you miss all the glory
And the mythical story
Of the Olympian life?

Yamaguchi in red
She had high rise and roses
And red-carpet poses
And her outfit was splendid

Nancy Kerrigan&#8217;s charm
Well she took quite a beating
So you&#8217;re not above cheating
Can you blame her for crying?

Tonya, you were the brightest
Yeah you rose from the ashes
And survived all the crashes
Wiping the blood from your white tights

Has the world had its fun?
Yeah they&#8217;ll make such a hassle
And they&#8217;ll build you a castle
Then destroy it when they&#8217;re done

Tonya Harding, my friend
Well this world is a bitch, girl
Don&#8217;t end up in a ditch, girl
I&#8217;ll be watching you close to the end

So fight on as you are
My American princess
May God bless you with incense
You&#8217;re my shining American star

Shining American star
Shining American star
Shining American star

Oh the delight of my eyes
Would you not sleep my love?
Are you the peacock or the plumage of the peacock?
Are you the cuckoo or the cry of the cuckoo?
Are you the moon or the light of the moon?
Are you the eyelashes, or the dream?
Are you the flower or the nectar?
Are you the fruit or the sweetness?</td>

Once there was a gypsy man
Selling flowers from a baker&#8217;s van
Bess she pulled him round the town
Pulled her wagon all old and brown
Till one day we took her away
Painted her wagon bright and gay
Now she finds she&#8217;s travelling
North No more wandering back and forth

Once there was an Afghan hound
Loved by no one and pushed around
Tied up in a stable yard
Tangled and timid and howling hard
Till one day we took her away
Called her Magog shortened to May
She hurt a paw made it sore
Now she runs on three legs instead of four

There lived a dog in London Town
With one ear up and the other ear down

The neighbours said he mustn&#8217;t bark
The only grass he knew was in Hyde Park
Till one day we took him away
Now Blue bounces through fields of hay
But he sits and squeals like a squeaky wheel
When the wheels are rolling that&#8217;s how he feels

Little green wagon in a deep blue sky
Wheels like dandelions passing by
With a picture by Sam a painting by John
And a bonnie black hoss to lead you along
Lucky green wagon you were raggedy brown
Now there is red at the hem of your gown
We brought you a pumpkin brought you a mouse
We wished very hard and you gave us a house

Jog along Bess hop along May
Squeak along Blue it&#8217;s a walk along day
It&#8217;s a long road and weary are we

You bade the white road turn for me

Lock up the lark love

And drove our dreams like sheep with you

Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Oh why, oh why can't I?

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme

Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strand
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
"Fools," said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence"</td>

She was 3 years older than me, but in no time we became friends
We'd listen to her mix tapes; Dead Can Dance, Felt, This Mortal Coil...
She introduced me to her favourite books, gave me clothes, and my first cigarette
Sometimes we would head down to Blackbirds moor to watch the barges on Grand Union in the twilight
She said "The water has no memory"
For a few months everything about our lives was perfect
It was only us, we were inseparable
But gradually she passed into another distant part of my memory
Until I could no longer remember her face, her voice, even her name

We have got, we have got the perfect life</td>

Blown on the steel breeze.

Come on you stranger, you legend,

You cried for the moon.

Threatened by shadows at night,
And exposed to the light.

With random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper,
You prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and
I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child,
You winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion,
and shine!</td>

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

It makes me wonder
It makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

It makes me wonder
It really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadow's taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven</td>

On a raft in the quarry
Slowly sinking
On the back of a lorry

Dreadfully sorry
Apple scrumping
Born in the war
Birthday punching

In the glittering ballroom
Greyly outrageous
In my high heel shoes
Tightly undone
They know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic
That their heroes are news

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ah, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah

Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small

It was twenty years ago today
When Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, &amp; Ringo Starr]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, &amp; George Harrison]
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Segue: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison &amp; Ringo Starr]
Billy Shears!

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney &amp; George Harrison]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney]
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney &amp; George Harrison]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr, John Lennon, Paul McCartney &amp; George Harrison]
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr, John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?

And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed

And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...</td>

Who were leaving for the coast

They might just as well have been closed

Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in darkness with the radio playin' low

And the secrets that we shared
Mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
Till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I

Guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and running to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe

Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind
Well, I'm older now and still running
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Still running
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
Against the wind
I'm still running

See the young man run
Against the wind
Watch the young man run

Watch the young man runin'

But we can love oh yes we can love
And my brothers back at home with his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff

And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane, there is a fireman with an hour glass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies in summer
Meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now, do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage bronkin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book on Marx
A quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry 
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye

Had one little promise she was gonna keep

And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
'Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
No, no!

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?

Yeah

There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by the bye
And the parting on the left
Is now parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Get up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
No, no

Yeah

Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss</td>

Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
I ran outta songs to play
I came into town a one-night stand
Looks like my plans fell through

For every song I've sung
Every time I've had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train

Watch your honey drip, can't keep away

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Hey, baby, whoah, baby, pretty baby
Darlin' can't you do me now?
Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby

Didn't take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by "down and out"
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friends she gonna be a star
I don't know, but I been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah

Steady loaded woman gonna come my way

Goin' California with an achin' in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell ya that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
Mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun begin to awake
Watch out

Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it's starting to flow
I think I might be sinkin'
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
Meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings, la la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standin' on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, mmm ah</td>

Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said
"Hey, boy, do you wanna score?"
And you know how it is
I really don't know what time it was, whoa-oh-oh
So I asked them if I could stay awhile.

I didn't notice, but it had got very dark and I was really,
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me asked us said
"Please, hey, would we care
To all get in line, get in line."
Well, you know
They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, whoa-oh-oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sittin' spare like a book on a shelf rustin'
Ah, not tryin' to fight it
You really don't care if they're comin', whoa-oh-oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better
You better open your eyes, whoa-oh yeah
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now
So I'm packin' my bags for the misty mountains,
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills, where the spirits fly.

Play the song with the funky break"
And go-kart Mozart
Was checking out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early Pearly
Came by in his curly wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride

Asked me if I needed a ride
'Cause she was blinded by the light

She's gonna make it to the night

Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is

Some brimstone baritone
Anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone
Hit it in its funny bone
That's where they expect it least"
And some new mown chaperone
Was standing in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone
Was messing with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance

Sprung from cages on Highway 9
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected and steppin' out over the line

It's a death trap
It's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, and baby, we'll never go back

Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know if love is wild
Babe, I wanna know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the palace
Hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard

The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in the mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss, huh

One, two, three, four
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all of the madness in my soul

Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place where we really wanna go
And we'll walk in the sun

Come on

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by ya
Make you look like a fool, boy

Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in; he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Alright!

Well, there's a girl that lives up the block
Back at school she could turn all the boys' heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed

Her and her husband Bobby, well, they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talkin' 'bout the old times
She says when she feels like crying she starts laughing thinking about

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Rock it now
Wooh

I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink 'til I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will

Yeah, just sittin' back trying to recapture
A little of the glory, yeah
Well, the time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister
But boring stories of

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Breathe Reprise

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire

Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell</td>

Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down

The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

I mean he get off light, 'cos I could've given him a thrashing, I only hit him once.  It's only a difference of right and wrong innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they, eh?

Down and out
It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about 

Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice

And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and...then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door...and he looked inside

Just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow

Well, I've tried so hard baby
But I just can't see
Oh, what a woman like you
Is doing with me

So tell me who I see

Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
Oh, when out go the lights

I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now, you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand

Oh, we stood at the altar
The gypsy swore our future was bright
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love

Can you show me where it hurts?

A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone

Lions and tigers who wait in the shadows
They're fast but they're lazy and sleep in green meadows

Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
I'm a snake if we disagree

Just say a word and the boys will be right there
With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air
Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?
Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder
I'll write on your tombstone, "I thank you for dinner"
This game that we animals play is a winner

Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
I'm a snake if we disagree, yes

The rivers are full of crocodile nasties
And He who made kittens put snakes in the grass
He's a lover of life but a player of pawns
Yes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn
To light up His jungle as play is resumed
The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune

Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
I'm a snake if we disagree, yes

Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
I'm a snake if we disagree

Let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes</td>

I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, none can equal the splendor

Surely heaven waits for you

In every house and on every street
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete

Don't step on Greta Garbo
As you walk down the boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile
That's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

Rudolph Valentino
Looks very much alive
And he looks up ladies' dresses
As they sadly pass him by
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life

If you covered him with garbage
George Sanders would still have style
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn 'round and smile
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
'Cause she's not very tough
She should have been made of iron or steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in show-biz
It doesn't matter who you are
And those who are successful
Be always on your guard
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard

I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
'Cause celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die

You can see all the stars as you walk along Hollywood Boulevard

And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
Is walkin' around with me
And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realise
How much I love you

It's time to go home now
And I've got an achin' head
So I give her the car keys
And she helps me to bed
And then I tell her as I turn out the light
I say, "My darlin', you were wonderful tonight
Oh, my darlin', you were wonderful tonight"</td>

On the pot of gold

Appeared above my head

Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, baby
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

We headed for the skies, singing

Learning fast as the weeks went past

Wait in this place

Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue
When the trains come back
Lie with you
Where the shadows run from themselves

At the party, she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

There's an open road that leads nowhere,
So just make some miles between here and there
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame.

Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman,
Evil woman.

Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold, too hot to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
And you found a fool lyin' in a daze
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do?
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feelin' pain
But you better get your face on board the very next train.

Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman,
(You're an evil woman) evil woman.

Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman,
(You're an evil woman) evil woman.

Evil woman, how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha, ha, funny how you broke me up,
You made the wine, now you drink a cup
I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha, ha, very nice to know
That you ain't got no place left to go.

Evil woman, evil woman, evil woman,
(You're an evil woman) evil woman
Evil woman, evil woman,
(You're an evil woman) evil woman
(Such an evil woman) evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman)
Evil woman...</td>

Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere, a queen is weeping
Somewhere, a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries, "Mary"

The traffic lights, they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead

And the wind screams, "Mary"

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, "No, this will be the last"

I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha trying to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"
I said, "Excuse me"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord
A-pointing that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me, but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Oh, won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, a-mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, a-mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure

Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Oh, won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, a-mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, a-mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"

Head's all empty and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seein' double
Pays my ticket when I speed

She come skimming through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia
Ringin' that blue bell
Golder than sunlight
Go on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey, come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight
Crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round
I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream
Walkin' in the tall trees
Goin' where the wind blows
Bloomin' like a red rose
Breathin' more freely
Light out singing, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream
Walk you in the sunshine</td>

Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sitting and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Outta the door and down to the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me you got to play your hand
Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Living on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is, ain't it a shame

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

And you're sick of hangin' around and you like to travel
Get tired of travelin' you wanna settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get outta the door and light out and look all around

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a-goin' home
Whoa-whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on</td>

Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 6]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times

How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air

T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, the evil one
Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, her, her, yeah

And ain't nothing I can do, no

I guess I'll keep on rambling, I'm gonna shake
Sing my song, I've gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song

I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my babe, I really got to part
I gotta keep searching for my baby
I gotta keep-a searching for my baby

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
A good kind of love, want a higher love

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

Bring it, oh

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Whoa, bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh (bring me)
Bring be a higher love (whoa)
Bring be a higher love (whoa, bring me a higher love)

Title: Smoke On The Water







We all came out to montreux

On the lake geneva shoreline

To make records with a mobile

We didn&#8217;t have much time

Frank zappa and the mothers

Were at the best place around

But some stupid with a flare gun

Burned the place to the ground



Smoke on the water

fire in the sky



Smoke on the water





They burned down the gambling house

It died with an awful sound

Funky claude was running in and out

Pulling kids out the ground

When it all was over

We had to find another place

But swiss time was running out

It seemed that we would lose the race



Smoke on the water

fire in the sky



Smoke on the water





We ended up at the grand hotel

It was empty cold and bare

But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside

Making our music there

With a few red lights and a few old beds

We make a place to sweat

No matter what we get out of this

I know

I know we&#8217;ll never forget

Smoke on the water

fire in the sky



Smoke on the water

Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
"Welcome to the Home by the Sea"

Coming out the woodwork, through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows with no substance, in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sigh and they moan

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
"Welcome to the Home by the Sea"

Sit down... Sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer, longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance, photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
"Welcome to the Home by the Sea"

Sit down... Sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you

Sit down... Sit down
Cause you won't get away
No with us you will stay
For the rest of your days. So sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you</td>

Hotel California

On a dark desert highway,
cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas,
rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance,
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
&#8217;this could be heaven or this could be hell&#8217;
Then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to The Hotel California
Such a lovely place.. such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at The Hotel California
Any time of year.. any time of year,
you can find it here
Her mind is tiffany-twisted,
she got the mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,
that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard,
sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember,
some dance to forget
So I called up the captain,
&#8217;please bring me my wine&#8217;
He said, &#8217;we haven&#8217;t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine&#8217;
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say-ay...
Welcome to The Hotel California
Such a lovely place.. such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin&#8217; it up at The Hotel California
What a nice surprise!.. what a nice surprise!,
bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said &#8217;we are all just prisoners here, of our own device&#8217;
And in the master&#8217;s chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can&#8217;t kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
&#8217;relax,&#8217; said the night man,
We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like,
But you can never leave!

In the heart of the cold, cold city

He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster, the lights are turning red"

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane

Are you with me so far

Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they were heavily billed

There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice she was caught up in the race
Out every evening until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane

Blowing and burning, blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worse
She said, "Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring
We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing"

He said, "Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash"
"The doctor say he's coming, but you gotta pay in cash"
They went rushing down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dying to get off
And it was

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time

Hush, hush
She broke my heart, but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush

Many times I've wondered
How much there is to know

Many dreams come true
And some have silver linings
I live for my dream
And a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man
Who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men
Can't see the open road

Many is a word
That only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing
You really ought to know
Really ought to know
I really ought to know
You know I should, you know I should, you know I should</td>

So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said:
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good

I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go
I come back to the place you are

So much wasted

Working so hard for our survival

To keep me awake and alive

And these three men made a solemn vow:
John Barleycorn was dead

They've let him lie for a very long time
Till the rains from heaven did fall
And little Sir John sprung up his head
And so amazed them all

They've let him stand till midsummer's day
Till he looked both pale and wan
And little Sir John's grown a long, long beard
And so become a man

They've hired men with the scythes so sharp
To cut him off at the knee
They've rolled him and tied him by the way
Serving him most barbarously

They've hired men with the sharp pitchforks
Who pricked him to the heart
And the loader he has served him worse than that
For he's bound him to the cart

They've wheeled him around and around the field
Till they came unto a barn
And there they made a solemn oath
On poor John Barleycorn

They've hired men with the crab-tree sticks
To cut him skin from bone
And the miller he has served him worse than that
For he's ground him between two stones

And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl
And he's brandy in the glass
And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl
Proved the strongest man at last

The huntsman, he can't hunt the fox
Nor so loudly to blow his horn
And the tinker he can't mend kettle nor pot

Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name

Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all, it was you and me

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah

Get down, baby

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you is just the nature of my game
Mmm, yeah

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

To sit with elders of a gentle race

Who talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
Though not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear

As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find
Where I've been, ah-ah, ah-ah

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Who hid the path that led me to that place
With yellow desert screen

My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that blows high in June
When moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging

Oh, you've gone to the finest school, alright, miss lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get
Used to it

With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say: "Do you want to
Make a deal?"

How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To hang on your home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking thinking that they
Got it made
Exchanging all their precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, baby

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets
To conceal

How does it feel?

My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
With a 5'9" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all, yeah

Woo!

I saw her head out to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
And Charlie said "I hope that you're able, boy
Hon', I'm telling you she knows where it's at"
Well, suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her "Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared"

I've gotta be forgiving
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9" beautiful tall
Well, with just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all
Ooh, had it all
Ha, she had it all, yeah</td>

Twenty four before my love, you'll see I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud, the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind, the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create, as weather spins out of hand

Go closer, hold the land, feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears, we stand surrounded by million years

I'll be the roundabout

Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive

People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock

Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive

Landslide, rocks are falling
Falling down 'round our very heads
We tried but you were yawning
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead

The place is really jumping to the high-watt amps
'Til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

Long live rock, I need it every night

I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face, really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face

You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days</td>

Windshield wipers slapping time, I was holding bobby's hand in mine,
We sang every song that driver knew.

Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,
Nothing don't mean nothing honey if it ain't free, now now.

Good enough for me and my bobby mcgee.

Through all kinds of weather, through everything that we done,
Hey bobby baby kept me from the cold.

One day up near salinas, lord, I let him slip away,
He's looking for that home and I hope he finds it,
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holding bobby's body next to mine.

They just helped you on your way, through your busy dying day

Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are caught in the devil's bargain

Why then don't you show it?

But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You're in with

Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with?

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck"
But you don't mean it

When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it?

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them

And know I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem?

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is

There is nothing that we need

Why do we never get an answer

Because the truth is hard to swallow
That's what the war of love is for

It's not the way that you say it

It's more the way that you mean it

And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see 
What it's done to me
To lose the the love I knew
Could safely lead me through

Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me

But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see 
What it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old
The secrets of our souls

Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care

And the line of cars goes down real slow

And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh, one more radar lover gone

When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost

I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation an' they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"</td>

Heading out for the east coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
Split up on a dark, sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
"We'll meet again someday on the avenue"
Tangled up in blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I's lucky for to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the sight of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said, "Tell me, don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the caf&#233;s at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going back again
I got to get her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't what they do with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue</td>

Standing, stretching every nerve
I had to listen, had no choice
I did not believe the information
Just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
"Son," he said, "grab your things
I've come to take you home"

To keep in silence, I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
Till I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom
"Hey," he said, "Grab your things
I've come to take you home"
Yeah, back home

When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty, she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouette
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant

It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
I got a bottle of rose, so let's try it

"We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe
And I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go

And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, "Trust some of this, it'll show you where you're at 
Or at least it'll help you really feel it"

Well by the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her, 'cause I was to loose to fake
I said, "I'm hurt," she said, "Honey, let me heal it"

And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice
Just as soft as a spirit in the night

In the night
Oh, Janey don't know what she do to ya
Like a spirit in the night
All night
Stand right up now and let it shoot through me

Well now the night was bright and the stars threw light 
On Billy and Davy dancing in the moonlight
They were down near the water having a stoned mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn

Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt
He ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt
Singin' our birthday song

Janey said it was time to go 
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row 
Felt so right
Together we moved like spirits in the night

I walk in smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up

If you start it up
Kick on the starter give it all you got, you got, you got

If you rough it up
If you like it you can slide it up, slide it up, slide it up, slide it up

You got to never, never, never stop
Slide it up
Slide it up
Slide it up (never, never, never)

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen

Start it up
Love the day when we will never stop, never stop
Never, never, never stop
Tough me up
Never stop, never stop

You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man come

Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh

Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh, yeah
Ooh

Way on down south, way on down south, London town

You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes, and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play Creole
Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast with one more thing

They seek the truth before they can die

Teach your parents well
Their children's health will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked, the one you'll know by

Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them back inside 
And know they love you</td>

[Verse 1]
Yeah, come on all of you, big strong men
Uncle Sam needs your help again
He's got himself in a terrible jam
Way down yonder in Vietnam
So put down your books, pick up a gun
Gonna have a whole lot of fun

[Chorus]
And it's 1, 2, 3
What are we fighting for?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam
And it's 5, 6, 7
Open up the pearly gates
Ah, ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee!
We're all going to die

[Verse 2]
Well come on generals let's move fast
Your big chance has come at last
Gotta go out, get those reds
The only good commie is the one that's dead
And you know that peace could only be won
When we've blown them all to kingdom come

[Chorus]
And it's 1, 2, 3
What are we fighting for?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam
And it's 5, 6, 7
Open up the pearly gates
Well, there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee!
We're all going to die

[Verse 3]
Well come on Wall Street don't move slow
Why man, this is war-a-go-go
There's plenty good money to be made
By supplying the Army with the tools of the trade
Just hope and pray that if they drop the bomb
They drop it on the Viet Cong

[Chorus]
And it's 1, 2, 3
What are we fighting for?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vietnam
And it's 5, 6, 7
Open up the pearly gates
Well, there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee!
We're all going to die

[Verse 4]
Well come on mothers throughout the land
Pack your boys off to Vietnam
Come on fathers don't hesitate
Send them off before it's too late
Be the first one on your block
To have your boy come home in a box

[Chorus]
And it's 1, 2, 3
What are we fighting for?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn

And asked for nothing in return
Would you do the same for me as I would for you?
Or take me for a ride
And strip me of everything including my pride

My words but a whisper, your deafness a shout.
I may make you feel but I can't make you think.
Your sperm's in the gutter, your love's in the sink.

So you ride yourselves over the fields and
You make all your animal deals and
Your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick.

And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away
In the tidal destruction the moral melee.
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way.

But your new shoes are worn at the heels
And your suntan does rapidly peel
And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick.

And the love that I feel is so far away:
I'm a bad dream that I just had today
And you shake your head
And say it's a shame.

Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth.
Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth.
Spin me down the long ages, let them sing the song.

See there! A son is born --
And we pronounce him fit to fight.
There are black-heads on his shoulders,
And he pees himself in the night.
We'll make a man of him
Put him to trade
Teach him to play Monopoly
And not to sing in the rain.

The Poet and the painter casting shadows on the water --
As the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea.
The do-er and the thinker: no allowance for the other --
As the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed.
The home fire burning: the kettle almost boiling --
But the master of the house is far away.
The horses stamping -- their warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning of the day.
And the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword.

And the youngest of the family
Is moving with authority.
Building castles by the sea,
He dares the tardy tide
To wash them all aside.

The cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea:
The builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need.
The young men of the household have all gone into service
And are not to be expected for a year.
The innocent young master -- thoughts moving ever faster --
Has formed the plan to change the man he seems.
And the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword.

And the oldest of the family
Is moving with authority.
Coming from across the sea,
He challenges the son
Who puts him to the run.

What do you do when the old man's gone --
Do you want to be him?
And your real self sings the song.
Do you want to free him?
No one to help you get up steam --
And the whirlpool turns you 'way off-beam.

Later.
I've come down from the upper class
To mend your rotten ways.
My father was a man-of-power
Whom everyone obeyed.
So come on all you criminals!
I've got to put you straight
Just like I did with my old man --
Twenty years too late.
Your bread and water's going cold.
Your hair is too short and neat.
I'll judge you all and make damn sure
That no one judges me.

You curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone --
You meet the stares. You're unaware that your doings aren't done.
And you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be.
But how are we supposed to see where we should run?

I see you shuffle in the courtroom with your rings upon your fingers
And your downy little sidies and your silver-buckle shoes.
Playing at the hard case, you follow the example
Of the comic-paper idol who lets you bend the rules.

So! Come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books your super crooks
And show us all the way.
Well! Make your will and testament.
Won't you? Join your local government.
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day.

You put your bet on number one and it comes up every time.
The other kids have all backed down and they put you first in line.
And so you finally ask yourself just how big you are --
And take your place in a wiser world of bigger motor cars.
And you wonder who to call on.

So! Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though?
They're all resting down in Cornwall --
Writing up their memoirs for a paper-back edition of the Boy Scout Manual.

Later.
See there! A man born --
And we pronounce him fit for peace.
There's a load lifted from his shoulders
With the discovery of his disease.
We'll take the child from him
Put it to the test
Teach it to be a wise man
How to fool the rest.

Quote
We will be geared to the average rather than the exceptional
God is an overwhelming responsibility
We walked through the maternity ward and saw 218 babies wearing nylons
It says here that cats are on the upgrade
Upgrade? Hipgrave. Oh, Mac.

Later
In the clear white circles of morning wonder,
I take my place with the lord of the hills.
And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured (in neat little rows)
Sporting canvas frills.
With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention,
While queueing for sarnies at the office canteen.
Saying -- how's your granny and good old Ernie:
He coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win.

The legends (worded in the ancient tribal hymn) lie cradled in the seagull's call.
And all the promises they made are ground beneath the sadist's fall.
The poet and the wise man stand behind the gun,
And signal for the crack of dawn. Light the sun.

Do you believe in the day?
Do you? Believe in the day!
The Dawn Creation of the Kings has begun.
Soft Venus (lonely maiden) brings the ageless one.

Do you believe in the day?
Do you? Believe in the day!
The fading hero has returned to the night --
And fully pregnant with the day, wise men endorse the poet's sight.
Do you believe in the day?
Do you? Believe in the day!

Let me tell you the tales of your life
Of your love and the cut of the knife
The tireless oppression the wisdom instilled
The desire to kill or be killed.
Let me sing of the losers who lie
In the street as the last bus goes by.
The pavements are empty: the gutters run red --
While the fool toasts his god in the sky.

So come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus.
Mark the precise nature of your fear.

Let me help you pick up your dead
As the sins of the father are fed
With the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise
And from the pan under your bed.
Let me make you a present of song as
The wise man breaks wind and is gone while
The fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and
The nursery rhyme winds along.

So! Come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus.
Mark the precise nature of your fear.
See! The summer lightning casts its bolts upon you
And the hour of judgement draweth near.
Would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour
Or the wiser man who rushes clear.

So! Come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't your rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books your super-crooks
And show us all the way.
Well! Make your will and testament.
Won't you? Join your local government.
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day.

So! Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you through?
They're all resting down in Cornwall -- writing up their memoirs
For a paper-back edition of the Boy Scout Manual.

Of course
So you ride yourselves over the fields
And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick.</td>

Though his mind is not for rent

His reserve, a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist, catch the myth
Catch the mystery, catch the drift

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide

Today's Tom Sawyer
He gets high on you
And the space he invades
He gets by on you

No his mind is not for rent

To any God or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is

And what you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness, catch the wit
Catch the spirit, catch the spit

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his eyes are wide

Exit the warrior

He gets high on you
And the energy you trade
He gets right on to the friction of the day

East of Omaha
You can listen to the engine
Moaning out its one-note song
You can think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're riding sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go -- turn the page

Well, you walk into a restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Most times you can't hear 'em talk
Other times you can
All the same old clich&#233;s:
"Is that a woman or a man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
So you don't dare make a stand

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go -- turn the page

Out there in the spotlight
You're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy
You try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body
Like the music that you play

Later in the evening
As you lie awake in bed
With the echoes from the amplifiers
Ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Remembering what she said

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go -- turn the page

Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, "I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk"
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one</td>

And your feet flyin' up in the air

School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this

but committed no crime

and bad mistakes

i've made a few

i've had my share of sand

kicked in my face

but i've come through

and i need to go on and on and on and on
we are the champions - my friend
and we'll keep on fighting till the end
we are the champions
we are the champions
no time for losers
'cause we are the champions of the world
i've taken my bows
and my curtain calls
you've bought me fame and fortune
and everything that goes with it
i thank you all
but it's been no bed of roses no pleasant cruises
i consider it a challenge before the whole human race
and i ain't gonna lose
and i need to go on and on and on and on

we are the champions - my friend
and we'll keep on fighting till the end
we are the champions
we are the champions
no time for losers
'cause we are the champions of the world
we are the champions - my friend

and we'll keep on fighting till the end

we are the champions
we are the champions

no time for losers

'cause we are the champions..

They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, "Come on, dudes, let's get it on"
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down

I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said, "You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away"
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwin' punches around
And preachin' from my chair

Well, who are you?

Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Tell me who are you

I took the tube back outta town
Back to the rollin' pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccuped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the tin pan
God there's got to be another way

I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

Beg to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA'

He spoke of lands not far
Nor lands they were in his mind
Of fusion captured high
Where reason captured his time
In no time at all he took me to the gate
In haste I quickly
Checked the time
If I was late
I had to leave, to hear your wonderous stories
Had to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA, LA AHA'

Hearing
Hearing hearing your wonderous stories
Hearing your wonderous stories
It is no lie I see deeply into the future
Imagine everything
You're close
And were you there
To stand so cautiously at first
And then so high
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky
I bid it to return
To hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories
La ah la ah ah ah

My voice too rough with cigarettes (ooh)

But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets (ooh)

I love to hear you say my name

You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now

And I look pretty crappy sometimes (ooh)

Made a meal out of me

Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

[Verse 2]
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

[Bridge]
I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?
[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

[Refrain]
Every little thing, every little thing
Every, every little thing
Every little, every little, every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
That she does is magic
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh

[Verse 1]
Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above
The din of our Rice Krispies
We can't hear anything at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Mother chants her litany
Of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take

[Chorus]
Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

[Verse 2]
Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered
Through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why
[Pre-Chorus]
The secretaries pout and preen like
Cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting
With his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch

[Chorus]
Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings
Into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy grips the wheel
And stares alone into the distance
He knows that something
Somewhere has to break
He sees the family home
Now looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs
That makes his eyeballs ache
[Chorus]
Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake

[Outro]
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away
Many miles away</td>

Of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past

[Verse 2]
You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

[Chorus]
Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)
[Verse 3]
My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind

[Verse 4]
I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

[Chorus]
Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long

[Verse 5]
This is the night
Of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

[Chorus]
I'll learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel

Then you begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulder

For well you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude, you'll do

She arrived one February morning, pale and shellshocked, from past lives I could not imagine
She was 3 years older than me, but in no time we became friends
We'd listen to her mix tapes; Dead Can Dance, Felt, This Mortal Coil...
She introduced me to her favourite books, gave me clothes, and my first cigarette
Sometimes we would head down to Blackbirds moor to watch the barges on Grand Union in the twilight
She said "The water has no memory"
For a few months everything about our lives was perfect
It was only us, we were inseparable
But gradually she passed into another distant part of my memory
Until I could no longer remember her face, her voice, even her name

We have got, we have got the perfect life</td>

Music by Gilmour  

Lyrics by Gilmour / Samson 

&#184;&#232;&#180;&#202;&#214;&#198;&#215;&#247;:&#200;&#203;&#214;&#174;&#179;&#245;

High Hopes&#213;&#226;&#202;&#215;&#184;&#232;&#202;&#199;Pink Floyd&#181;&#196;&#215;&#168;&#188;&#173;Division Bell&#192;&#239;&#181;&#196;&#181;&#218;11&#202;&#215;

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start

Cathedrals in my heart

And we saw, Whoa-Oh-Oh, this light
I swear you emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright, as we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, Oh, is a waterfall
Oh-Oh-Oh is a waterfall
Every teardrop is a waterfall, Oh-Oh-Oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag
It was a waterfall, a waterfall

Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall</td>

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Album: X &amp; Y

---------------
---------------
---------------

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse?

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worst?

Lights will guide you home,
And ignite your bones,
And I will try to fix you,

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

I'm waiting for the call, the hand on the chest
I'm ready for the fight, and fate

The sound of iron shocks is stuck in my head,
The thunder of the drums dictates

The rhythm of the falls, the number of deaths
The rising of the heights, ahead

From the dawn of time to the end of days
I will have to run, away
I want to feel the pain and the bitter taste
Of the blood on my lips, again

This steady burst of snow is burning my hands,
I'm frozen to the bones, I am
A million mile from home, I'm walking away
I can't remind your eyes, your face</td>

Were hidden under the grid
Young and naive, I never believed
That love could be so well hid
With regret, I'm willing to bet
And say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive
And harder to forget

It gets under your shirt
Like a dagger at work
The first cut is the deepest
But the rest still flipping hurt
You build your heart of plastic
Get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up?
When you're coked up
And can't remember the reason why you broke up?
You call her in the morning
When you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road

'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you wanna be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies, they flutter by and leave us on our arses

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
'Cause all I wanna do is try to make a connection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

Oh, I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
And I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

It seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh

We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other

But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over

When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

All we need is somebody to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on</td>

Put me to your lips
I am sick
I will punch a baby bear in his shit
Give me lip
I'ma send you to the yard, get a stick
Make a switch
I can end a conversation real quick

I am crack
I ain't lyin', kick a lion in his crack
I'm the shit, I will fall off in your crib, take a shit
Pinch your momma on the booty
Kick your dog, fuck your bitch
Fat boy dressed up like he's Santa
And took pictures with your kids

We the best
We will cut a frowny face in your chest, little wench
I'm unmentionably fresh, I'm a mensch, get correct
I will walk into a court while erect, screaming "Yes!
I am guilty motherfuckers, I am death"

Hey, you wanna hear a good joke?

Nobody speak, nobody get choked

Get running
Start pumping your bunions, I'm coming
I'm the dumbest, who flamethrow your function to Funyuns
Flame your crew quicker than Trump fucks his youngest
Now face the flame, fuckers, your fame and fate's done with

I rob Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Linus and Lucy
Put coke in the doobie, roll woolies to smoke with Snoopy
I still remain that dick grabbin' slacker that spit a loogie
Cause the toter of the toolie'll murder you friggin' Moolies
Fuck outta here, yeah

Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak
Nobody speak

Only facts I will shoot a
Baby duck if it quacks, with a Ruger
Top billin', come cops some villainous shots is blocked
Shipped out, and bought, and y'all feeling it
El-P killin' it, Killer Mike killin' shit

What more can I say? We top billin' it
Valiant without villainy
Viciously foul victory
Burn towns and villages
Burning looting and pillaging

Murderers try to hurt us we curse them and all their children
I just want the bread and bologna bundles to tuck away
I don't work for free, I am barely giving a fuck away

So tell beggin' Johnny and Mommy to get the fuck away
Heyyo here's a gun, son, now run, get it the gutterway
Live to shoot another day

Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak
Nobody speak
Nobody speak, nobody get choked</td>

Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it

They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah

For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded 20 bad bitches, yeah

Everything costing like I'm at the bottom, yeah, yeah

Now I can scream that we made it
Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulations
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby
I'm looking for someone to call, baby
But right now I got a situation
Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins
Big rings, champagne
My life is like a ball game
But instead I'm in the trap, though
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
Top floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post
Malone, I got a play on my phone, ay

Huncho Houdini is gone, ay

And please don't find her skin
When you turn the lights out

I can't erase it
From my mind
I just replay it, love
Think of it all of the time

But I don't want to imagine
Words you spoke to her that night
Naked bodies look like porcelain
You both know I'd be bleeding inside

Did she make your heart beat faster than I could?
Did she give you what you hoped for?
Oh nights so loveless, love

No heroes villains want to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone.
Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end for you and me
Oh, the show, it can't go on.

We used to have it all
But now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause (woah woah oh oh)
And wave out to the crowd
And take our final bow
Oh, it's our time to go
But at least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show

Least we stole the show

Darlin', darlin'
You know that we are sold out
This is fading
But the band plays on now
We're crying, crying
So let the velvet roll down, down.

No heroes villains want to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone.
Our debut was a masterpiece
Our lines we read so perfectly
But the show, it can't go on.

We used to have it all
But now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause (woah woah oh oh)
And wave out to the crowd
And take our final bow
Oh, it's our time to go
But at least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show

Stole the show
Least we stole the show
Stole the show

You're walking in the woods
There's no one around, and your phone is dead
Out of the corner of your eye, you spot him. (Shia LaBeouf)
He's following you, about 30 feet back
He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint
He's gaining on you! (Shia LaBeouf)
You're looking for your car, but you're all turned around
He's almost upon you now, and you can see there's blood on his face!
My god, there's blood everywhere!

[Chorus 1]
Running for your life from Shia LaBeouf
He's brandishing a knife, it's Shia LaBeouf
Lurking in the shadows, hollywood superstar Shia LaBeouf
Living in the woods, Shia LeBeouf
Killing for sport, Shia LaBeouf
Eating all the bodies, actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf

[Verse 2]
Now it's dark, and you seem to have lost him
But you're hopelessly lost yourself, stranded with a murderer
You creep silently through the underbrush
Aha! In the distance, a small cottage with a light on!
Hope!
You move stealthily toward it, but your leg! Ah! It's caught in a bear trap!
[Chorus 2]
Gnawing off your leg (Quiet, quiet)
Limping toward the cottage (Quiet, quiet)
Now you're on the doorstep
Sitting inside, Shia LaBeouf
Sharpening an ax, Shia LaBeouf
But he doesn't hear you enter, Shia LaBeouf
You're sneaking up behind him
Strangling superstar Shia LaBeouf
Fighting for your life with Shia LaBeouf
Wrestling a knife from Shia LaBeouf
Stab it in his kidney
Safe at last from Shia LaBeouf

[Bridge]
You limp into the dark woods, blood oozing from your stump leg
You've beaten Shia LaBeouf
Wait! He isn't dead! Shia Surprise!
There's a gun to your head, and death in his eyes
But you can do Jiu Jitsu
Body Slam superstar Shia LaBeouf
Legendary fight with Shia LaBeouf
Normal Tuesday night for Shia LaBeouf
You try to swing an axe at Shia LaBeouf
But blood is draining fast from your stump leg
He's dodging every swipe, he parries to the left
You counter to the right, you catch him in the neck
You're chopping off his head now
You have just decapitated Shia LaBeouf
[Outro]
His head topples to the floor, expressionless
You fall to your knees and catch your breath
You're finally safe from Shia LaBeouf</td>

And all their school books and their running shoes
Washing them clean in the dirty steel sink

Concentrates my mind
Helps me to sleep

Keep making beds, keep the cat fed
Open the windows, let the air in
Keep the house clean, keep the routine
Paintings they made still stuck to the fridge

Keep cleaning, keep ironing
Cooking their meals on the stainless steel hob
Keep washing, keep scrubbing
Long until the dark comes to bruise the sky
Deep in the debt to night

My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess]
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise the glass
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Interlude: Janelle Mon&#225;e]
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight

[Bridge: Nate Ruess]
The moon is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home?

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

[Outro: Nate Ruess]
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home tonight</td>

I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

[Verse 3]
You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son, call me young gun
I'm a young gun

Robin Thicke:
If you can&#8217;t hear what I&#8217;m trying to say
If you can&#8217;t read from the same page
Maybe I&#8217;m going death, maybe I&#8217;m going blind
Maybe I&#8217;m out of my mind

Pre-chorus:
Ok now he was close, tried to domesticate you
But you&#8217;re an animal, baby it&#8217;s in your nature
Just let me liberate you
Hey, hey, hey
You don&#8217;t need no papers
Hey, hey, hey
Than man is not your maker

Chorus:
And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m gon&#8217; take a good girl,
I know you want it

You&#8217;re a good girl
Can&#8217;t let it get passed me
You&#8217;re far from plastic
Talk about getting blasting
I hate these blurred lines

The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

One thing I ask you
Let me be there when you &#8230; that ass too
Yo, from Malibu, to Paribu

So hit me up when you pass through
I&#8217;ll give you something big enough to take your ass too
Swag on, when when you dress casual
I mean it&#8217;s not most unbearable
Then, honey you&#8217;re not there when I&#8217;m
With my foresight b*tch you pay me by
Nothing like your leg, I ain&#8217;t too square for you
I&#8217;ll smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I jail watch, hand wave for you to salute
But you didn&#8217;t pick
Not many women get a &#8230;
But I&#8217;m a nice guy, but you get it if you get with me

Robin Thicke:
Shake the vibe, get down, get up,

When I'd only one hand for goodbyes, then.

I slipped under the empty bed,
Got lost inside the dark hollows.
It's the black of your lenses I still can't see through.
And if you had been looking at me,
Then you'd know I'd intended to leave, here.

I don't get to make you nervous. But I got to, tonight.
I don't mean to make you nervous, I'm gonna have to, this time. 

I've gotta know we're better here than we were last year.

I can never just say what I mean,
Can only manage to say something similar.
If my tongue wasn't moored to the bow of my lips
Then I'd surely be able to say,
That our black and white has become grey. 

I don't get to make you nervous. But I got to, tonight.

Turn up the woofers so I can feel the beat
Vibrate my belly like a bomb in harmony

You're waiting for someone to push you away

Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cos I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hearable
What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy
Lifeless
To know the definition for what life is
Priceless
For you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?

The essence the basics
Without it you make it
Allow me to make this
Child, like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child and beast
Every cloud you see
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion heprovides
with me as a guide
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing, remember
(that it's all in your head)

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long

Drive on engines 'til they weep
With future pixels in factories far away

All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year

And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

Uh
Mmmmm...

I got a feeling now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul

I prayed on the immovable
Yeah, clinging to the atoms of rocks
Seasons, the adjustments, signs of change

I can't see now she said taxi
Now red light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties, and skies

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Uh
(That's electric)

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time everyday, same routine
Clear target in the summer when skies are blue

It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Natures corrupted in factories far away

(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
Uh
(That's electric)
With future pixels in factories far away

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor

It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?

And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Have a little voice to speak with

It's okay, girl, I feel it too
Let it be, baby breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good

Of the blood on my lips, again

Como puede ser verdad

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Refrain:

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me

Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

(refrain)

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

(refrain x 2)

La la la la la la la
Te dijo te amo
La la la la la la la
El dijo que te ama</td>

Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make it like it never happened and that we were nothing
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over

But had me believin it was always something that I'd done

But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know-oh-oh

But you didn't have cut me off
Make it like it never happened and that we were nothing (oh)
I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger
and that feels so rough

(oh)

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect you records
And then change your number (oh)
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (now your just somebody that I used to know)
That I used to know
Somebody that I used to know
Somebody (somebody) (now your just somebody that I used to know)
That I used to know

I used to know

My, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say "Oh, my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet

It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oak town
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy
(You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know
(You can't touch this)

Look at my eyes, man
(You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
(You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now, you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat

While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that

Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

Yo, I told you
(You can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man?
(You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka
(You can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' about the Hammer, you talkin' about a show

That's hype and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the nineties to burn

The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
You can't touch this, you can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Go with the funk, it is said
If you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead

So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair

This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump

Yeah
(You can't touch this)
Look, man
(You can't touch this)

You better get hype, boy
Because you know you can't
(You can't touch this)b
Ring the bell, school's back in

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic

Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo, Hammer"
And the rest can go and play

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Yeah, you can't touch this
I told you, you can't touch this
Too hype, can't touch this
Get way outta here, you can't touch this</td>

Come in the likeness in the image of God.
Because, you can be like that.
With all that humbleness, and all that respect.
All of the power invested in me
Be it hard to love my enemies.
All of the black bags over the heads of the dead and dying.
The more I understand about the human race
The less I comprehend about our purpose and place
And maybe if there was a clearer line the curiosity would satisfy.
Time based prophecies that kept me from living
In the moment I am struggling
To trust the divinity of all the guides
And what the hell they have planned for us.
I cry for the creatures who get left behind
But everything will change in a blink of an eye
And if you wish to survive
You will find the guide inside.
I go back and forth every single day
The clarity that comes to me in a choppy way
As the feelings
And the places
And the seasons change
The galaxies remain.
Energy fields cone the body in space.
The angels that are coming from a spiritual waste.
The hate that gets me distant from my spiritual pace.
Ten fold the manna when the planets are in place, in polar alignment.
We're on assignment.
Bodies on consignment.
Return them to the circus
And what is the purpose?
What is the purpose and would you believe it?
Would you believe it if you knew what you were for
And how you became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.

I am not a leader, just a creature.
Stick the peaches of my teacher when you follow where they lead.
All mysterious ways of nature and I am in to it.
Changing management.
And there are various ways to conquer this, monotonous, metropolis
My stubbornness is bottomless
My fear is this is talking shit
And I am wide awake and I am taking names.Do you speak to me like you speak to God?
All the love and understanding between the father and the son?
Do you believe in the perfectness of where you are?
He's my people he's my children it's the land that I would fight for.
I saw an ebonese telling me to patiently move the music medicine around the planet in a hurry.
Cuz there's no time to waste.
Got to wake up the people time to stand up and say
We know what we are for
And how we became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable
Than my own meandering experience, I will dispense this advice now

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind
You will never understand the power
And the beauty of your youth until they've faded
But trust me, in twenty years
You will look back at photos of yourself

And recall in a way you can't grasp now
How much possibility lay before you
And how fabulous you really looked
You are not as fat as you imagine

Don't worry about the future or worry that know that worrying
Is as affective as trying to solve an algebra equation
By chewing bubble gum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things
That never crossed your worried mind
The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday

Do one thing every day that scares you, sing
Don't be reckless with other peoples' hearts
Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours, floss
Don't waste your time on jealousy
Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind
The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself

Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults
If you succeed in doing this, tell me how
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements, stretch
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what to do with your life

The most interesting people
I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't
Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to knees, you'll miss them when they're gone

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the "Funky Chicken"
On your 75th wedding anniversary
Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
Or berate yourself either
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body, use it every way you can
Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it

It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own, dance
Even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room
Read the directions even if you don't follow them
Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Brother and sister together will make it through
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings, they are your best link to your past
And the people most likely to stick with you in the future
Understand that friends come and go
But a precious few, who should hold on

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle
For as the older you get, the more you need the people
You knew when you were young
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard
Live in northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft

Travel, accept certain inalienable truths
Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old
And when you do, you'll fanaticise that when you were young
Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble
And children respected their elders

Respect your elders, don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse
But you'll never know when either one will run out
Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're forty
It will look eighty-five
Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it

Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of
Wishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off
Painting over the ugly parts and recycling for more than it's worth
But trust me on the sunscreen

Brother and sister together will make it through, oh yeah
Someday a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out, whenever I can

Everybody's free, oh yeah, everybody's free, oh yeah, oh, to feel good</td>

Now every February you'll be my valentine, valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep

Don't ever look back

My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a floor out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees
(Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek
(At us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock
West-coast represent
Now put your hands up

Sex on the beach
We've got white sand in our stilettos
We freak in my jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock

West-coast represent
Now put your hands up

Toned, tanned, fit, and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild, wild west-coast
These are the girls I love the most

I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak, she drive a Jeep
And live on the Beach

I'm okay, I won't play, I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everyday

Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zuchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

Katy, my lady?
(Yeah?)
Looky here, baby
(Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause your represtin' California

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock
West-coast represent
Now put your hands up

I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby

Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You see, my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

[Pre-Chorus]
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, oh

"All aboard!"
"Britney! Before you go, there's something I want you to have."
"Oh, it's beautiful! But wait a minute, isn't this...?"
"Yeah, yes, it is."
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end."
"Well, baby, I went down and got it for ya."
"Aw, you shouldn't have!"

That's all we need because it's all we can take

One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
But no one gives us any time anymore

He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it then you ran off
I've got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

He sees right through me it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he will fall

One thousand lonely stars, hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't want to sing anymore

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again

Kinda counted on you being a friend

Feel the earth move

Hear my heart burst
again.

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt
this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Or face it all 
together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Or face it all together
At skyfall

Is at skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
When worlds collide, and days are dark
You may have my number, 
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all... together

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)

(When it crumbles)

(We will stand tall)

(let the sky fall)

(When it crumbles)

(We will stand tall)

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know i'd never be me
without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all... together
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)

Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Oh why, oh why can't I?

Oh someday I'll wish upon a star

When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go
Don't let go
...to my love

Can I get to your soul
Can you get to my thoughts
Can you promise we won't let go
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm loosing control

I hate to see you cry
Your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry
My love is dying inside

I can fix all those lies
But baby, baby I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I

Can I get to your soul
Can you get to my thoughts

Consoles me

On your patient lips

In motion

My patience
Controlling

I won't speak

We're telling
The stories
Our laughter
He knows me

We're leaving
We're talking
You're closer
It's calming

That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips

The night will hold us close and the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone
I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

Kind to some, but not to thee
Born with a rare and sad disease
She grew &#8212; a ham &#8212; where her head should be
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
Her dream was to be a famous star
But at the rate she was goin', she wasn't going fa-a-ar
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Her father was a simple man (Duh!)
He wanted to help, "in any way that I can!"
Home from school, he watched his daughter cry
In the yard, he cursed God and fired at the sky
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
Her dreams in the sky, her father felt her pain
And as he shot at the clouds, it began to rain
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Got a call from the doctor
He had some amazing news for her
He just developed a cure
If she hurried over now, he'd try it out on her
Burst out the door, she was beaming
Among the raindrops her happy tears were streaming
Finally freed from her pain
But something else fell with the rain
A stray bullet shot by her father
Aimlessly nested inside her
She fell to the the sidewalk, now empty
Of the life which once christened her body
"Nurse, s-she's... she's gone."
"O-oh... oh dear."
"I left a lunch on the table in the operating room for the bereaved, a cooked ham, as is customary for these... dark situations."
"U-uh, Doctor, what... which one is the... which... which one is the ham that&#8212;?"
"I-I must... I must go... I must... I must go, I'm on break."
"Oh dear."
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
At her time of death
The doc said "time to eat!"
So we took a bite out of her face meat
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore (La-la-oh...)
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Soaring infinitely through space
Hamantha's soul was graced
With a glance of our humble planet
At which she was amazed
The news of her untimely death
Had spread out near and far
And through her soul, the truth was whole
The dream had crossed the bar
Hamantha had become a star
Hamantha was finally a star
Hamantha had become a star
Hamantha was finally a star</td>
