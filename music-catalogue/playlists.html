Put me to your lips
I am sick
I will punch a baby bear in his shit
Give me lip
I'ma send you to the yard, get a stick
Make a switch
I can end a conversation real quick

I am crack
I ain't lyin', kick a lion in his crack
I'm the shit, I will fall off in your crib, take a shit
Pinch your momma on the booty
Kick your dog, fuck your bitch
Fat boy dressed up like he's Santa
And took pictures with your kids

We the best
We will cut a frowny face in your chest, little wench
I'm unmentionably fresh, I'm a mensch, get correct
I will walk into a court while erect, screaming "Yes!
I am guilty motherfuckers, I am death"

Hey, you wanna hear a good joke?

Nobody speak, nobody get choked

Get running
Start pumping your bunions, I'm coming
I'm the dumbest, who flamethrow your function to Funyuns
Flame your crew quicker than Trump fucks his youngest
Now face the flame, fuckers, your fame and fate's done with

I rob Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Linus and Lucy
Put coke in the doobie, roll woolies to smoke with Snoopy
I still remain that dick grabbin' slacker that spit a loogie
Cause the toter of the toolie'll murder you friggin' Moolies
Fuck outta here, yeah

Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak
Nobody speak

Only facts I will shoot a
Baby duck if it quacks, with a Ruger
Top billin', come cops some villainous shots is blocked
Shipped out, and bought, and y'all feeling it
El-P killin' it, Killer Mike killin' shit

What more can I say? We top billin' it
Valiant without villainy
Viciously foul victory
Burn towns and villages
Burning looting and pillaging

Murderers try to hurt us we curse them and all their children
I just want the bread and bologna bundles to tuck away
I don't work for free, I am barely giving a fuck away

So tell beggin' Johnny and Mommy to get the fuck away
Heyyo here's a gun, son, now run, get it the gutterway
Live to shoot another day

Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak, nobody get choked, hey
Nobody speak
Nobody speak
Nobody speak, nobody get choked</td>

Man didn't have to take off the door (Nah)
Pull up in the dinger, straight through the hole in the floor
We&#8217;re the toddlers, don't know what you thought
By the end of the night, you&#8217;ll be picking up your jaw
Plants, not ten or twenty
Run up in the crop gaff with Eggs Benny (Agh)
Mans 'ead got cracked and his legs went jelly (Blow)

[Verse 1]
Just know that we're leaving the room with every last penny
No joke, man don't boast
Just know it's over when you see Ghost
Spinning back kick might take off your nose
Man don't want that smoke
Big elbow to the top of the dome (What?)
Man don't want that smoke, nah
And I'm Ernie, the left hand's fast but the right hand's sturdy
They know I been bad from early
Your likkle 'eadlock can't hurt me
I'm fighting dirty, Jim (Chin)
You already know man can't fuck with him
When it comes to this fighting ting, manna head butt him (Yeah)
Put in the double 'ead take down
Primetime's like Joe Rogan with the MMA breakdown
And once everybody's sleeping, it turns into a playground

[Verse 2]
We&#8217;re the toddlers, are you dumb?
Just know that we come from the bottom of the slum
And we're hungry, means we're coming for the crumbs
And we're like a taxman, cah we're coming for your funds
Bang, bang, you see us in a gang
Hop out the back of the blue transit van (Yeah)
Nuff man have never had money in a bank
With these 25 grand in elastic bands (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We've always got drastic plans, like Bill Sykes we&#8217;ll take your pots and pans (Yeah)
How many million views did we do last week?
Man I got too many fans (What?)
Swear down, man are drastic
You don't wanna get left in a casket (What?)
If we run up in a crib and it's filled with weed, then we're leaving with it in a basket (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

On the border line of the edge

Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone

I walk alone

Translation
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick - ha ha!
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin

(Swifty)
Bitch it's too late

(Eminem)
Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

(Swifty)
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin, creatin murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face {*BLAM*}
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin every penny - it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin, I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin me they bracelets
Chillin in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin - throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

(Eminem)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

(Bizarre)
I'm a compulsive liar, settin my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?) Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*}
Lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*}
Lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*} (Damn!)
{*DJ reverses the record and scratches it back on beat*}
I'm fuckin anything when I'm snortin
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
{*dog whines*} Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin ass mom

(Proof)
Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin {*gun cocks*} nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin, get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
and found chopped up in a trash bag

(Kuniva)
We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell
cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a "Luni"
I got a "Yukmouth" and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin "Kuniva yo yo."
I leave ya face leakin, run up in church
and smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

(Kon Artis)
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
(Special delivery!) I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin in dough

(Eminem)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

(Eminem)
Haha. suck my motherfuckin dick
D-12. Dirty motherfuckin Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre Kid
Swifty McVeigh
The Kon Artis
The Kuniva
Dirty Harry

You don't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then

Couldn't even come in my room
Smell like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playin' casino
Cali's all I keep in my bag in California
Tell them to give me back my swag
They try to clone me

You see my Louis chucks, Louis bag, Louis frames,
Louis belt
What that make me
Louis Mane

With my new black watch called the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac wrist

And if I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard

I hit the sack
I've been too long I'm glad to be back [I bet you know I'm...]
Yes, I'm let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I've been looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild

Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang
With a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

Yeah

The pressure's building up
I feel like givin' up
How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up
When everything has changed?
It'll never be the same
Nobody knew me than everybody knows my name

And I feel so ashamed
I've never been the kind of nigga that would complain
But it's so crazy, man
There's no different
Everyday is just the same thing

Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doin' so many different shows
Head spinnin' feelin' like it's gonna explode
And I just wanna know

If anybody out there's feelin' me
I'm losin' my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let you know

Once got me insane, oh
'Cause I can't stand the Rain, hey
It's hitting my window pane
A little too much
And now I gotta let you know

Once I got my face in the frown, hey
'Cause I can't stand the sound, oh
Of the thunder that's crashing down
Upon my house
'Cause now I gotta let you know

Now I got no more worries now
My pocket's fatter now
Look in the mirror my reflections looks different now
It gettin' bigger
Akon, you need to settle down
Why do I feel this way?

Should I be happy or should I just ignore?
Everything that I've been givin' please help me, Lord
Please help me, Lord
It's all over but
I can't escape the Rain

Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doin' so many different shows
Head spinnin' feelin' like it's gonna explode
And now I gotta let you know

If anybody out there's feelin' me
I'm losin' my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
And now I gotta let you know

Once got me insane, oh
'Cause I can't stand the Rain, hey
It's hitting my window pain
A little too much
That's why I gotta let you know

Once I got my face in the frown, hey
'Cause I can't stand the sound, oh
Of the thunder that's crashing down
Upon my house

E'yo gringo e'yo gringo

See I woke up early as hell one morning
And I noticed my stash was half gone
'Cause these feen's can't stop smokin' ma rocks
'Cause around my way these nigga's been worry
Fighting for territory that's mine
'Cause these cats can't stop live 'cause of my shots
I'ma show you right now I'm reason the block is moving
I got dubs at the price of a dime
That's why I'm on top and I won't stop
'Cause I get it so cheap no matter what I won't be losing
Re-up spots is so hard to find
But I got one
Cool ass Mexican man

E'yo gringo e'yo gringo
I heard you wan some marijuana
Or some pure white coca
E'yo gringo e'yo gringo
See I never been a smoker

You can find me on the other side of the border
Where the 100 grand in my pocket
For the first trip jus' pack a lil somethin'
'Cause I'ma bring the work back by the air
Or even by water
Whatever it take to get to the crib
Gotta play it safe 'cause they out there
See I got so much client ale waiting
I can't just make one trip
But I gotta get enough to supply the sibling
But I gotta be careful smugglin' in
Vaseline rapped around so it hide the sent
While I wait Jose
He'll bring it to me

E'yo gringo e'yo gringo
I heard you wan some marijuana
Or some pure white coca
E'yo gringo e'yo gringo
See I never been a smoker
I'm just ur neighborhood dealer

Akon
Slim Shady

I see the one, because she be that lady! Hey!
I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)
I see it dull and backed now
I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!

I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

[Chorus (2x)]
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

[Eminem:]

Ooh...Looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a lil drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it!
Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my woodie back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, she's like "You're!"
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
Plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playing
"Akon!"

[Akon:]
I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me

Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

Eminem is rollin', d and em rollin' bo
And all marvelous them rolling
Women just holding big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwing "D!"
Hitting on less than "Three!"
Block wheel style like "Whee!"
Girl I can tell you want me because lately

I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh!

Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord
That's always been there
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride

Backtracking over these few years
Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through 
You still stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you're a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life girl I'm so...

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl 
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run 
And I would be out chasing you

'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see 
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)

Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)

Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (work it out baby)
I had never wished to ever hurt my baby (hurt my baby)
And it's drivin' me crazy 'cause I'm so...

I'm leaving my life in your hands

Risking it all in a glance

And how you got me blind is still a mystery

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did

Feels like it's deep within me, MMM-MMM-MMM

Title: "Shut Up"

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

We try'n to take it slow, but we still losin' control

Ya we try to make it work, but its still is the worst

And I'm craaazayyy, tryin' to be your laaaadayyy

I think I'm goin' craaaazay

Girl, me and you was just fine, ya know

We wine'd and dinned

did them things that couples do when in love, ya know

walks on the beach and stuff, ya know

Things that lova's say and do

"I love you boo", "I love you to"

"I miss you alot", "I miss you even more, thas why I flew you out when we were on tour"

But then somethin' got outta hand, you start yellin' why I was gripmans

Even though I had legitamate reasons(o sh*t)

You know I have to make them dividends(o sh*t)

How could you trust the private eye's girl

Thas why you dont believe my lies, and to quick to resent 

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

We try'n to take it slow, but we still losin' control

Ya we try to make it work, but its still is the worst

And I'm craaazayyy, tryin' to be your laaaadayyy

I think I'm goin' craaaazay

Why do we gotta move so fast

lova's part before you could make it last

Why is it that you just lose control

every time we agree on takin' it slow

So why does it havta be so d@mn tough

Cause fools like us could never get enough of love

Showin' the love that you be givin'

Changin' up your livin' for another transition

Goin' into submission

Tryin' to get you to listen

To be mad at each other has become out tradition

You yell, I yell, everybody yells

We got neighbors across the street sayin' ("WHO THE HELL")

Who the hell, what the hell's goin' down

To much of the bickering, kill it with the sound

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

We try'n to take it slow, but we still losin' control

Ya we try to make it work, but its still is the worst

And I'm craaazayyy, tryin' to be your laaaadayyy

I think I'm goin' craaaazay

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Shut up, just shut up shut up

Girl our love is dyin

Why can't you stop tryin

I never been a quitah

But I do deserve betta

Believe me I will do bad

Let's forget the past

And let's start this new plan

Why? Cuz it's the same old routine

And then next week I hear them scream

Girl I know you're tired of the things they say

You're damn right

Cuz I heard them lame dame excuses just yesterday

That was a different thing

No it ain't

That was a different thing

No it ain't

That was a different thing

It was the same damn thing

Same ass excuses

Boy you're usless

Whhoooaaaa

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, Just Shut Up Shut Up

Shut Up, J

Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to The Gallow's Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Motherfuckers!
Running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not so easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there is never an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell God be with you
If there's a God then why has he let me die?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away

Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
Please don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth

So when you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion

Oh, hallowed be thy
Name

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name

How it go, it's not a joke, there's gon' be a homicide
I'm a ride, I'm a rep me a nigga up in the box
And send 'em to his folks, his bloods, his kin
The drama it don't end, bust a gun
Bust a nigga's face open with the hand
Tell 'em go tell a friend, tell a cop, tell the FEDS
I don't give a mothafuck, you niggas in the Ps
I'm a let the world see you, you're a bitch, you're a snitch

If you got a cold heart then my shit just froze over

The windows on the crib, bullet proof them

On the block or the corner, you slip you a goner
Your nose's getting warmer, the Ds out for ya
Get money-money or take money-money
Always on my fly shit never catch the kid bummy
Shorty on my nuts like sweats
And it taste like metals and I swear I'm to protected
What do you expect, hoe niggas from let go

They say she low down, it's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em 
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood whore
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin' I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doing so I can pull up close
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful

Damn, girl!

David Guetta:
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, girl!
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, a sexy bitch
Damn, you's a sexy bitch, damn, girl!

Akon:
Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down, it's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em 
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

[Fergie]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over
No gettin over'
There's just no getting over you.

[Chris Willis]
Wish I could spin my world into reverse, just to have you back again
There's no getting over
There's no gettin over
There's just no getting over you (you)!

[LMFAO]
We're back
Hey hey I cant forget you baby
I think about you everyday
I tried to mascarate the pain
Thats why im next on the booth
D-d-d dance to the groove
There is no there is no getting over you.
Baby it feels so right
To dance to the beat up night
The heat between you and I retreat to the morning light
We like to live like class
And pour them shots up in the glass
But there is no,there is no getting over you.
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...
I'm a party, and party and party and party...
And party and party and party...

[Fergie]

When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go
Don't let go
...to my love

Can I get to your soul
Can you get to my thoughts
Can you promise we won't let go
All the things that I need

You can make it feel so real

Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm loosing control

Cause you can't deny

I hate to see you cry
Your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry
My love is dying inside

I can fix all those lies
But baby, baby I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I

Can I get to your soul
Can you get to my thoughts
Can you promise we won't let go

[Girls voice is Dina Rea]

[Intro]
Oooooh
You high baby
Yeah
Ya'
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something
Uh-huh
I know what you want to hear...

[Chorus A]
Cause, I know you want me baby, I think I want you too
"I think I love you baby", I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too
They call me superman, I'm here to rescue you
I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
"Ooooh boy you drive me crazy", bitch you make me hurl...

[Verse 1]
They call me superman, leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down, in a relationship
Save it bitch, babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase, I tell a muthafuckin' slut, to her face
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick, get my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out, won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit, wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice, buy you ice, bitch if you died, I wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be my new wife, what you Mariah, fly through twice...

[Prechorus]
But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo'
Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

[Chorus B]
Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman...

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong, I love these ho's
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what, that's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again, I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in, we'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I, I don't want to flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do, how could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you, we just met and I just fucked you...

[Prechorus]

[Chorus A / Chorus B]

[Verse 3]
First thing you say, "I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyways
You're just plain old Marshall to me"
Ooh ya' girl run that game
"Hailie Jade, I love that name, love that tatoo, what's that say"
"Rot in pieces, uh, that's great"
First off you don't know Marshall, at all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal, I'll slap you off that barstool
There goes another lawsuit, leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie, you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have, ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab, end up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a tampax, and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance, don't mean to ruin your plans...

[Prechorus]

Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. , I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song "" has gotten such rotten responses."

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on  (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

Album: Recovery
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife
In my windpipe
I can't breathe
But I still fight
While I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right
It's like I'm in flight
High of a love
Drunk from the hate
It's like I'm huffing paint
And I love it the more that I suffer
I sufficate
And right before im about to drown
She resuscitates me
She fucking hates me
And I love it
Wait
Where you going
I'm leaving you
No you ain't
Come back
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane
Cause when it's going good
It's going great
I'm Superman
With the wind in his bag
She's Lois Lane
But when it's bad
It's awful
I feel so ashamed
I snap
Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe
When you're with them
You meet
And neither one of you
Even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills
Used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick
Of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em
Never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom
And these words
When you spit 'em
You push
Pull each other's hair
Scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down
Pin 'em
So lost in the moments
When you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best
To go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
Cause today
That was yesterday
Yesterday is over
It's a different day
Sound like broken records
Playin' over
But you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things
Did things
That we didn't mean
And we fall back
Into the same patterns
Same routine
But your temper's just as bad
As mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love
You're just as blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you
Baby it was me
Maybe our relationship
Isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens
When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is
I love you too much
To walk away though
Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity
In my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed
I'll aim my fist
At the dry wall
Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize
Even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games
I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed
And set the house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright
Because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Hellogoodbye - Escape
Hi guys, this is Hellogoodbye...
You can run you can hide 
but you can't escape my love 
Here's how it goes 
You and me 
Up and down but maybe this time 
We'll get it right 
Worth a fight 
Cause love is something you can't shake 
When it breaks 
All it takes is some trying 
 
If you feel like leaving 
I'm not gonna make you stay 
But soon you will find that 
You can run you can hide 
but you can&#8217;t escape my love 
You should know 
It&#8217;s to hard 
It's to hard just to forget the past 
So fast 
In the end 
It was good but it was real but thats 
All it takes 
In the end, all that mattered 
If you feel like leaving 
I'm not gonna make you stay 
and soon you will find that 
You can run you can hide 
But you can&#8217;t escape my love 
But you can't escape my love 
Here's how it goes 
All it takes is some trying 
If you feel like leaving 
I'm not gonna make you stay 
But soon you will find that 
You can run you can hide 
but you can&#8217;t escape my love
You can run you can hide 
but you can&#8217;t escape my love
You can run... 
You can run...
You can run...
You can run...
You can run...
You can run...
You can run... 
You can run you can hide
But you can&#8217;t escape my love

And when you're out there,without care
Yeah I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
possibly

And I hope that you are havin' the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice

Come on now who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you
think you are, ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control

well,
I think you're Crazy
I think you're Crazy
I think you're Crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to live their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them.

Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And there's no considence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm Crazy
Maybe you're Crazy
Maybe we're Crazy
Probably!
Probably!

Old stylo (juice)
Go for blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is light
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes (as it leaps from the stream)
Then I'll know the twilight skies (blood curdles, its death throe)
Are not so broken hearted (hot from the end of the line)

If it's love, it'll be electric
It'll be flowing on the streets
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard

Sing yourself out of depression (juice)

In another world
In another world in the universe

It'll be flowing on the streets

Fall through space out of mind

Where the emptiness we leave behind on
Warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away
The falling of the whole empire is here
To hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sleeps

Little memories marching on
Your little feet working the machine
Say will it spin will it soar

Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they're
Going on

You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you've lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul

Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn&#8217;t pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You&#8217;re in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky, you and I</td>

Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well

It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
Ended kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny-dipping in the dark
Then had a m&#233;nage &#224; trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna sto-op
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Then had a m&#233;nage &#224; trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna sto-op
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again (Do it all again)

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
Ended kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law

You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

Boy, you're my lucky star

I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me

Fill me with your poison

Take me, ta-ta-take me

Album: Living Things (2012)
Take me down to the river-bend. 
Take me down to the fighting end. 
Wash the poison from off my skin. 
Show me how to be whole again. 
Fly me up on a silver wing. 
Past the black where the sirens sing. 
Warm me up in a nova's glow. 
And drop me down to the dream below. 
Cause I'm only a crack in this Castle of Glass. 
Hardly anything there for you to see. 
For you to see. 

Bring me home in a blinding dream. 
Through the secrets that I have seen. 
Wash the sorrow from off my skin 
and show me how to be whole again. 
Cause I'm only a crack in this Castle of Glass. 
Hardly anything there for you to see. 
For you to see. 

Cause I'm only a crack in this Castle of Glass. 
Hardly anything else I need to be. 
Cause I'm only a crack in this Castle of Glass. 
Hardly anything there for you to see. 
For you to see. 
For you to see.

Album: True Blue

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro

Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song

A young girl with eyes like the desert

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Chorus

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me

Te dijo te amo

I prayed taht the days would last

They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky

When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by

Beautiful faces, no cares in this world

Where a girl loves a boy

And a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze

All of nature, wild and free

This is where I long to be

La isla bonita

And when the samba played

The sun would set so high

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

You Spanish lullaby

I'm making my way over to
My favorite place
I gotta get my body moving
Shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew
That you'd be up in here, looking like you do
You make and staying over here, impossible
Baby, Ima say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

Do you know what you started?
I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist
Just let the music play
We're hand in hand chest to chest and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play

Please don't stop the music

Baby are you ready 'cause it's gettin' close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us no - one has to know
This is a private show

Do you know what you started?

They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes they're for no other
They didn't even cry a river

And she'll never know your story

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find

Been here all along, so why can't you see

You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you, drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See
You belong with me?

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door

This must be fake, my lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me?

[Bridge:]
Dreaming.(oh oh oh oh)
Of falling (mmm mmm mmm mmm)
Dreaming (ooh oh oh oh)
[B.o.B]
(ya) Lets pretend like it's 98
Like I'm eating lunch off of styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper comin out the A (A-town)
Hoping for a record deal to ignore my pain (ya)
Now lets pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (woo)
Okay
And everybody know my name and everywhere I go
people wanna hear me sing (oh)
Oh yeah and I just dropped my new album
on the first week I did Five-Hundred Thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond
in the fall and then a world tour just to top it all off
And lets pretend like they called me
the greatest selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and noone ever hated
Lets try to use imagination
[Chorus]
Okay lets pretend like this never happened (never)
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper (rapper)
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now lets pretend like it was all good (good)
like I didn't live staring in a notebook (notebook)
Like I did the things that
I probably knew I should (should)
But I aint have neighbours thats why they call it hood (hood yeah)
Now lets pretend like I aint got a name before they ever call me BOB aka Bobby ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes (yeah) before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before the ever once compared me to andre before I ever got on myspace
Before they ever noticed my face so lets just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes
[Chorus]
[Bridge II:]
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone (gone gone) and just memories
(oh oh)
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone (gone gone)
[Eminem]
Allright lets pretend Marshall Mathers
never picked up a pen
Lets pretend things would have been no different
Pretend he procrastinated had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin they could blow away with the wind
Marshall you're never gonna make it makes no sense to play the game there ain't no way that you'll win
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools were changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in a gymnasium bitch you won't amount to shit quit daydreaming kid
You need to get your cranium checked you thinking like an alien it just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it
And his alarm went off to wake him off but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics left to his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailey and Laney these food stamps and this *WIC* shit
Cuz he never risked shit he hopes and he wished it but it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here
He pretends that

A kiss that can't renew

Tip toe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace
ooh

There's no where left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die

Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
Falling from your grace

Sing for absolution
I will be singing
Falling from your grace

yeah

Now wrongs remain unrectified
And our souls won't be exhumed

About you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside, getting high on information
And buy me a star on the Boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

(Ooh ooh)

(Ooh ooh) Everybody's been there and I don't mean on vacation

Destruction leads to a very rough road, but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are, to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

And now you're here and you don't know why

Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

I am everything you want

Come closing in for a kill

Come feed the rain
'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
Dancing underneath the skies of lust 
Yeah, feed the rain 
'Cause without your love my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust

It's all a game, avoiding failure
When true colors will bleed
All in the name of misbehavior
And the things we don't need
I lust for after no disaster can touch
Touch us anymore
And more than ever
I hope to never fall
Where enough is not the same it was before

Come feed the rain

Dancing underneath the skies of lust
Yeah, feed the rain
'Cause without your love my life
Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust

Don't walk away, don't walk away, oh

Robin Thicke:
If you can&#8217;t hear what I&#8217;m trying to say
If you can&#8217;t read from the same page
Maybe I&#8217;m going death, maybe I&#8217;m going blind
Maybe I&#8217;m out of my mind

Pre-chorus:
Ok now he was close, tried to domesticate you
But you&#8217;re an animal, baby it&#8217;s in your nature
Just let me liberate you
Hey, hey, hey
You don&#8217;t need no papers
Hey, hey, hey
Than man is not your maker

Chorus:
And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m gon&#8217; take a good girl,
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You&#8217;re a good girl
Can&#8217;t let it get passed me
You&#8217;re far from plastic
Talk about getting blasting
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you&#8217;re a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

Verse 2: Robin Thicke
What do they make dreams on
When you got them jeans on
What do feelings &#8230; from
You the hottest b*tch in this place

Robin Thicke
I feel so lucky, you wanna hug me
Hey, hey, hey
What rhymes with hug me?
Hey, hey, hey

Pre-chorus:
Ok now he was close, tried to domesticate you
But you&#8217;re an animal, baby it&#8217;s in your nature
Just let me liberate you
Hey, hey, hey
You don&#8217;t need no papers
Hey, hey, hey
Than man is not your maker

Chorus:
And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m gon&#8217; take a good girl,

I know you want it

But you&#8217;re a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty

Verse 3: T.I.
One thing I ask you
Let me be there when you &#8230; that ass too
Yo, from Malibu, to Paribu
Yeah, had a big machine daddy
So hit me up when you pass through
I&#8217;ll give you something big enough to take your ass too
Swag on, when when you dress casual
I mean it&#8217;s not most unbearable
Then, honey you&#8217;re not there when I&#8217;m
With my foresight b*tch you pay me by
Nothing like your leg, I ain&#8217;t too square for you
I&#8217;ll smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I jail watch, hand wave for you to salute
But you didn&#8217;t pick
Not many women get a &#8230;
But I&#8217;m a nice guy, but you get it if you get with me

Robin Thicke:
Shake the vibe, get down, get up,
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
Watcha doing like word

Baby can you breathe? I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me Dakota to Dakata, uh huh
No more pretending,
Hey, hey, hey
Cause now you winning
Hey, hey, hey
Here&#8217;s our beginning

Chorus:
I always wanted a good girl,
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
You&#8217;re a good girl
Can&#8217;t let it get passed me
You&#8217;re far from ?lastic
Talk about getting blasting

To see what it has to say

You and I both know
Everything must go away
What do you say?

Spinning knot that is on my heart
Is like a bit of light in a touch of dark
You got sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark

Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
What do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot
You got no time for the afterthought
They're like ice cream for an astronaut
Well that's me looking for we

Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine?
Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time?
But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?

Pick you up like a paperback
With the track record of a maniac
So I move it in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday

Any way we roll
Everything must go away
What do you say? Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
From the LBC shore, wheels up on the G4
Louis bag with the Gucci loafs, silk shirt with a mink coat
Flying in, selling game to all you hoes and you're buying in
Legend in your presence, hiding
Got a room full of bitches and they lying there
High in there, ain't no fire, but a lot of wine in there
They get it, ain't no WiFi
On the low, close the door, bitch, I Spy
See when I pull up, jump in, we slip out
Roll up, roll out, get mines, dip out
She had to come and give a real Crip a taste
Out of pocket, never that stayin' in stripper's place
Big brown ass with some fat titties
And baby make magic when I'm in the city

Were hidden under the grid
Young and naive, I never believed
That love could be so well hid
With regret, I'm willing to bet
And say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive
And harder to forget

It gets under your shirt
Like a dagger at work
The first cut is the deepest
But the rest still flipping hurt
You build your heart of plastic
Get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up?
When you're coked up
And can't remember the reason why you broke up?
You call her in the morning
When you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road

'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you wanna be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies, they flutter by and leave us on our arses

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
'Cause all I wanna do is try to make a connection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

Oh, I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
And I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

It seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Well it seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

Dido - White Flag
lrc by the evil diva

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
I'll tell you that.
But if I didn't say it,
well I'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and
destruction to come back again
And I caused but nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
then I'm sure that that makes sense

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was then
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....
Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Title: Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)

They heard me singing and they told me to stop,
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock,
These days, my life, I feel it has no purpose,
But late at night the feelings swim to the surface.
Cause on the suburbs the city lights shine,
They're calling at me, come and find your kind.

Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small,
Then we can never get away from the sprawl,
Living in the sprawl,
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains,
And there's no end in sight,
I need the darkness someone please cut the lights.

We rode our bikes to the nearest park,
Sat under the swings, we kissed in the dark,
We shield our eyes from the police lights,
We run away, but we don't know why,
And like a mirror these city lights shine,
They're screaming at us, we don't need your kind.

Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small,
Then we can never get away from the sprawl,
Living in the sprawl,
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains,
And there's no end in sight,
I need the darkness someone please cut the lights.

They heard me singing and they told me to stop,
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock.

Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small,
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?
Living in the sprawl,
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains,
And there's no end in sight,
I need the darkness someone please cut the lights.

So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said:
"It's time for bed"

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good

Yo, it's a beautiful day, and everybody's feelin' wonderful
The ladies is out, lookin' fly, dressed comfortable
I love to wake up, and feel the breeze through my window
Slip on a fatigues, grab a dutch and roll some indo
It be days like these, that make life so much easier
Fish thawin' out, Guinness Stout in the freezer
Walk the block at my leisure (my leisure)
Summertime is like a anesthesia
So many pretty things to please ya
The greenery
Beautiful birds, natural scenery
Or even just a infinite sky
We be forever puffin' lah
On the block, or tellin' jokes in the ride (ha ha ha)
When the weather be hot, everybody be outside (whut)
Havin' fun (aight?), eatin' fresh fruits and vegetables
And good food put me in the mood for a festival
Some say the summer make a woman more sexual (s'up, boo)
It's instinct -- that's why my game be right on schedule
I put the great Mother Nature on a pedestal
She always fly, but today, she's exceptional
If I had a chance to make a wish
Every day would be just like this, full of Happiness

I feel great
Even though we got mad things to deal with
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be livin'
Feelin' fine
Leavin' my bad times behind

Feels great
And no, we can't escape from the realness
Happiness is all in the mind
Let's unwind, and find a reason to smile
I'm just glad to be alive
Feelin' fine
Livin' life one day at a time
Feelin' great

Yeah, knaw'msayin'?
I just wanna give a shout out
To everybody who got a birthday today
Happiness (Happiness)

Have you ever heard the children play?
Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a j, and get away
Put some food on the grill
And just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
'Cause it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune, 'cause it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh), a day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out, all night to sunrise
Celebration of life, 'cause every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to (uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind (whut)
You can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind</td>

I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And Mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one

Six-gun at my side,

Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
We're gonna take some time to do the things we never have

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti

Frightened of this thing that I've become

I try to be discreet
But then blow it again

I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy
One too many times

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake, but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, My Baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I tried to go on like I never knew you

I'm awake, but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go (Alone)

I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake, but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is incomplete

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish some one up there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge
And where I walk alone

Read between the lines
What's f*cked up and everything's all right

Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk alone

I walk alone
I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

I walk alone
I walk a

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a

Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here

But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys trying to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down

There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and

It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend (so lonely)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend, yeah

Even if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes, sometimes

It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend (so lonely)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo, it's a lo, it's a lonely weekend</td>

I was just coastin'
Never really goin anywhere
Caught up in a web I was gettin kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue
I fell for you

[Chorus]
Now you're lifting me up, instead of holding me down
Stealing my heart instead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

[Verse 2]
Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt till you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

[Chorus]
Now you're lifting me up instead of holding me down

Stealing my heart instead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Now you're lifting me up instead of holding me down
You're taking my hand instead of taking my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied

[Chorus]
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

When I'm having the time of my life

Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes

No, I've never been this far off of the ground

But I don't wanna come down

But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'

And then he's tearing me out
Taking me apart at my friend's house
I was uncomfortable, I was hurt
Still with blue innocence in his eyes
I felt my reasoning was harsh

With every stab wound and exhale, I promised myself
That I would never lose my youthful fears of grown up men
I'm scarred with cruel intentions
I thought of another the whole time
Who would have never stared me like that
See, he saw me as a human
This one thinks I'm a slaughterhouse

He pretends that he's understanding
And you know in the grand scheme of everything
He's probably called a nice man
Or an ordinary kind of man
Or a stereotype with strong hands, I'm so sad
At how little joy I realized within my time with my ex guy
Before these statues arrived

Romance is dead and done
And it hits between the eyes on this side
The grass is dead and barren
And it hurts between my thighs on this side

I could begin to open up and risk desire
For I move slower and quieter than most
I grew up too quick and I still forgive too slow
Oh, I wish there was another way

Romance is dead and done
And it hits between the eyes on this side
The grass is dead and barren
And it hurts between my thighs on this side

See me here, meet me here
I don't care if it's not repeated
I want to know who you are
For every second we outrun the moon, dread the sun come up
I want to know who you are
So I don't have to check my stuff's still here when you're gone
I want to know who you are
I want to know who you were

Romance is dead and done
And it hits between the eyes on this side
The grass is dead and barren
And it hurts between my thighs on this side

Before she says
"Know someone else has taken your place"
"I know it's over"
Icarus says to the sun
The Sword sinks in
Lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight till it's over
Fight till it's done
Oh oh oh oh oh
Didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh ah ooh ooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost,
We would have been saved
Oh ah ah ah ah
Now we're stopping the world
Stopping in its tracks but
Nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over
Before you run
Ah ah
Didn't we have fun?

Cause you and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be
We were always meant to always meant to

You and me we were always meant to
Always meant to be

Wooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh oh didn't we have fun?

But then
Maybe we could again</td>

Big said it increase the complication
Kane said don't step, I ain't the one
Chuck said that Uzi weigh a motherfucking ton
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking every stage and every place that it brought me
I'm awfully underrated, but came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma state it for the record
I am the opposite of whack; opposite of weak
Opposite of slack; synonym of heat; synonym of crack 
Closest to a peak, far from a punk
Y'all ought to stop talking, start trying to catch up, motherfucker

With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there,
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we dead it, Forget it,
Let it all disappear.

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control....

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go...

(Oh!) I know what it takes to move on,
I know how it feels to lie,
All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last,
I wish it wasn't so...
(Oh!) I know what it takes to move on,
I know how it feels to lie,
All I wanna do

Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And i don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin?
The hardest part of ending Is starting again!!

All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what i haven't got...

This is not the end
This is not the beginning,
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violet rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em
(Holding on to what i haven't got)

We say Yeah!
With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there,
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear

Wish I had known that
What seemed so strong
Has been and gone

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we'd both stay out 'til the morning light
And we sang, "Here we go again"
And though time goes by
I will always be
In a club with you
In 1973
Singing "Here we go again"

So I could see clearly now
The rain has gone

My memory plays out to
The same old song

If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes
Put your sunglasses on

"Shake well before use," she said
You never touch me anymore this way
Connector in, receiver out
You let me in through the back door

Ride the sainted rhythms
On the midnight train to Romford
Ride the sainted rhythms

Sweet in winter, sweet in rain
"Shake well before use," she said
You never touch me anymore this way
Oh no, connector, connector, connector, connector
You're a connector, connector, connector, connector

I'm so dirty and the light blinds my eyes
You're oh so dirty and the light, it blinds my eyes
Here comes Christ on crutches

"Call me wet trampoline," she said today
But I was too busy with my hand
"Shake well before use," she said
But you never touch me anymore
I was busy listening for phone sex
Coming through the back door in skin tight trunks
And we all went mental and danced

I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six

To the off peak electricity
And the light blinds my eyes and I feel dirty
And the light blinds my eyes and I feel so shaken in my faith
Here comes Christ on crutches

And here comes another God, here comes another God
Like a buffalo thunder, with a smell of sugar
And a velvet tongue and designer voodoo
But I got phone sex to see me through the emptiness in my 501s
Freeze dried with a new religion
And my teeth step back in my head

I get my kicks on channel six
The light, it burns my eyes and I feel so dirty
Here comes Christ on crutches

I will not be confused
Will not be confused
You left me confused
I will not be confused with another man
This pressure of opinions

"Lighten up, listen to your eyes," you said
But all I could see was Doris Day in a big screen satellite
Disappearing down the tube hole on Farringdon Street
With whiplash Willy, the motor psycho

And the light, it burns my eyes
And the light, it burns my eyes
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six</td>

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

With your James Dean glossy eyes.
In your tight jeans with your long hair,
And your cigarette stained lies.

Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

I'll never talk again, oh,

You've left me speechless, so speechless.

And I'll never love again, oh,
Boy, you've left me speechless,
You've left me speechless, so speechless.

I can't believe how you slurred at me,
With your half wired broken jaw.
You popped my heart seams,
All my bubble dreams, bubble dreams.

I can't believe how you looked at me,
With your Johnnie Walker eyes.
He's gonna get you, and after he's through,
There's gonna be no love left to rye.

And I know that it's complicated,
But I'm a loser in love, so, baby,
Raise a glass to mend,
All the broken hearts,
Of all my wrecked up friends.

I'll never talk again, oh,
Boy, you've left me speechless.
You've left me speechless, so speechless.

And I'll never love again, oh,
Friend, you've left me speechless,
You've left me speechless, so speechless.

How? How? How?
How? How? How?

And after all the drinks,
And bars that we've been to,
Would you give it all up? (How?)
Could I give it all up for you? (How)

And after all the boys, 
And the girls that we've been through,
Would you give it all up? (Give it all up.)
Could you give it all up (Give it all up.)
If I promise, boy, to you?

That I'll never talk again,
And I'll never love again.
I'll never write a song,
Won't even sing along,
I'll never love again. How?

So speechless, eh, -ess.
You left me speechless, 
So speechless, eh, yeah.

Will you ever talk again? Oh,
Boy, why you so speechless? (Speechless, baby)
You left me speechless, so speechless.

Some men may follow me,
But you choose death and company,
Why you so speechless, oh, oh?</td>

I've had enough, enough, enough,
And this is my prayer, I swear,
I'm as free as my hair.
I'm as free as my hair.

Sometimes I want some
Racoon or red highlights.
(Uh huh, uh huh)
Just because I want my friends,
To think I'm dynamite.
(Uh huh, uh huh)
And on Friday rocks in,
High school dance.
(Uh huh, uh huh)
I got my bangs too hot,
That I don't stand a chance.
(Uh huh, uh huh) a chance.

I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to love me for who I am. 
I just wanna be myself,
And I want you to know, I am my hair.

I've had enough, this is my prayer,
That I'll die living just as free as my hair.

Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast 

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me, a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Stay away
Look out

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman

But you're holding back like you're afraid of me

Just one night to be with you
I would show you how I break it all down
We could get lost, wear my hair down

So many possibilities, one chance
Baby, take my hand
'Cause it's not so complicated when I say

It's not impossible to love me, want to share my life
Promise I'm gonna get you right
It's not impossible and you'll see
I wanna share my life, want to love you all right

It's not impossible
It's not impossible
Nothing's impossible
I'm not impossible

What's the reason you keep me waiting?
It's obvious you can't take your eyes off me
It's getting late and you're making me impatient
Are you afraid that you might fall for me?

Just this night to be with you
I would have you open on it
Missing my kiss, looking for me
Telling your friends

But it's not that difficult, at all
Wanna break the ice, let's make noise
All you can do is try, please believe

It's not impossible to love me, want to share my life
Promise I'm gonna get you right
It's not impossible and you'll see
I wanna share my life, boy, I love you all right

So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X &amp; O
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I
Whoa

Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll

I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes.

Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan.

That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder

I knew it was ova, that Henny &amp; Cola
Got me like a Soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky oo me, I was just like a clover
Shorty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster

I broke everything new again, everything that I'd owned
I threw it out the windows, came along, extreme ways I know
Will part the colors of my sea, perfect color me

Extreme ways that help me, that help me out late at night
Extreme places I had gone, but never seen any light
Dirty basements, dirty noise, dirty places coming through
Extreme worlds alone, did you ever like it then?

I would stand in line for this
There's always room in life for this

Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Like it always does, always does

Extreme sounds that told me, they helped me down every night
I didn't have much to say, I didn't give up the light
I closed my eyes and closed myself and closed my world and never opened
Up to anything that could get me along

I had to close down everything, I had to close down my mind
Too many things that caught me, too much can make you blind
I've seen so much in so many places, so many heartaches, so many faces
So many dirty things, you couldn't even believe

I would stand in line for this
It's always good in life for this

Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh, baby, oh, baby
Like it always does, it always does</td>

I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're tryin to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together,
through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like 
you've been down the same road 
(same road)

You could try and read my lyrics 
off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out 
these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma 
let you stop me from causin mayhem
When I say 'em or do somethin I do it,
I don't give a damn what you think,
I'm doin this for me, 
so f-ck the world Feed it beans,
it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin me
I'ma be what I set out to be, 
without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me 
I'm tearin down your balcony
No if ands or buts, 
don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" 
album he's still shittin,
whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits 
his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, 
like a f-ck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, 
forget the Earth, he's got the urge
to pull his dick from the dirt, 
and f-ck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, 
through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like 
you've been down the same road 
(same road)

Okay quit playin with the scissors and shit,
and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words 
in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, 
you lied through your teeth, 
for that F-ck your feelings, 
instead of gettin crowned you're gettin capped
And to the fans,
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, 
in fact Let's be honest, that last 
"Relapse" CD was ehhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin back to that now
All I'm tryin to say is get back, 
click-clack, blaow
Cause I ain't playin around
It's a game called circle 
and I don't know how,
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out 
but I guess I didn't, 
this f-ckin black cloud still follows,
me around but it's time to exorcise 
these demons These muh'f-ckers 
are doin jumpin jacks now!

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, 
through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like
you've been down the same road 
(same road)

And I just can't keep living this way
Sooo starting today, 
I'm breaking out of this caaaaage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life
back together right now! (now)

It was my decision to get clean, 
I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it 
subliminally for you,

so I could come back a brand new me
you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did,
believe me you
I been through the ringer, 
but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, 
I feel like the king of
my world, haters can make like bees 
with no stingers and drop dead, 
no more beef lingers 
No more drama from now 
on, I promise to focus solely on handlin
my responsibilities as
a father So I solemnly 
swear to always treat this roof, 
like my daughters and raise it, 
you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
Cause the way I feel,
I'm strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub, 
and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
I'll shoot for the moon 
but I'm too busy gazin at stars
I feel amazing and I'm

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together,
through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like 
you've been down the same road

It's the black of your lenses I still can't see through.
And if you had been looking at me,
Then you'd know I'd intended to leave, here.

I don't get to make you nervous. But I got to, tonight.
I don't mean to make you nervous, I'm gonna have to, this time. 

I've gotta know we're better here than we were last year.

I can never just say what I mean,
Can only manage to say something similar.
If my tongue wasn't moored to the bow of my lips
Then I'd surely be able to say,
That our black and white has become grey.

For a moment in time?
Then you'd see that I can't be,
Your excuse for a lover.
A steep mountain to climb.
You would see.

I left my shoes under your bed
but I left my body outside.
How could I get back into this mess?
I kept telling myself the temptations would do me in.

From my lonely point of view
See every time that I'm with you
I think this will happen again.</td>

I am crack
I ain't lyin', kick a lion in his crack
I'm the shit, I will fall off in your crib, take a shit
Pinch your momma on the booty
Kick your dog, fuck your bitch
Fat boy dressed up like he's Santa
And took pictures with your kids

We the best
We will cut a frowny face in your chest, little wench
I'm unmentionably fresh, I'm a mensch, get correct
I will walk into a court while erect, screaming "Yes!
I am guilty motherfuckers, I am death"

Nobody speak, nobody get choked

Get running
Start pumping your bunions, I'm coming
I'm the dumbest, who flamethrow your function to Funyuns
Flame your crew quicker than Trump fucks his youngest
Now face the flame, fuckers, your fame and fate's done with

I rob Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Linus and Lucy
Put coke in the doobie, roll woolies to smoke with Snoopy
I still remain that dick grabbin' slacker that spit a loogie
Cause the toter of the toolie'll murder you friggin' Moolies
Fuck outta here, yeah

Shipped out, and bought, and y'all feeling it

What more can I say? We top billin' it
Valiant without villainy
Viciously foul victory
Burn towns and villages
Burning looting and pillaging

Murderers try to hurt us we curse them and all their children
I just want the bread and bologna bundles to tuck away
I don't work for free, I am barely giving a fuck away

So tell beggin' Johnny and Mommy to get the fuck away
Heyyo here's a gun, son, now run, get it the gutterway
Live to shoot another day

Have you lustin' for her, go crazy face it now

Think she double jointed from the way she splitted
Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it
She's so much more than you're used to
She knows just how to move to seduce you
She gone do the right thing and touch the right spot
Dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop

The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
Make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch

In her fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking
All into my set sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watchin' her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, let the ride break it down-down-down
You know I like when you hike and you throw it all around
Different style, different move, damn I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I do to you
Let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Lemme talk to ya

My guess is yes you can like, can I kick it? wicked
Liquor shot
If u happy and u know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flow it
Broke a pen and i'm in cope hymen
Dope or rhymin all worth it then
The hope diamond
Required off the blackmarket
Or wire tappin
Couldn't target a jar of spit
The rapid fire spark lit
zzzzt!
A rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or a dapper.
Plug yer trap or it's maximum exposure
The beast got family in numbers asking 'em for closure
Aw, send 'em a gun an tell em clean it
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong
A billabong
And said, nah, fo'realla
The Villain on a Gorilla jawn?

In case you act quite difficult
And your is so weaken with anger and
discontent
Some are seeking and searching like me, moi

I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for
retaliation
I change the whole occasion to a pine box
six-under
Impulsive, don't ask wild wonder
Orders given to me is 'Strike' and I'm
thunder

With lightning fast reflexes on constant

alert
From the constant hurt that seems limitless
With no dropping pressure
Seems like everybody's out to test ya
'Til they see your brake

They can't conceal the hate that consumes
you
I'm the reason why you flipped your soosa
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days digit and I'm filled with
guilt
From things that I've seen

Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a
canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a
light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
The war is over, so said the speaker

With the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I wanna do is dance

Dance, dance, dance

DO YOU KNOW
Do you know
Do you know,
Do you know, Do you know
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that&#8217;s in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.
If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year.
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can&#8217;t get it to speak
Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I&#8217;m standing on the edge and I don&#8217;t know what else to give.
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that&#8217;s in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.
How can I love you How can I love you How can I love you . . . .
If you just don&#8217;t talk to me, babe.
I flow through my act
The question is she needed
And decide all the man I can ever be.
Looking at the last 3 years like I did,
I could never see us ending like this.
Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that&#8217;s never happened to me.
But after this episode I don&#8217;t see, you could never tell the next thing life could be
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that&#8217;s in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.
Do you know what it feels like loving someone that&#8217;s in a rush to throw you away.
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.

Lyrics By : Manav (Yuvraj)
 
you 
do you remember me? 
like, i remember you?
do you spend your life, going back in your mind to that time? 
cause i
i walk the streets alone
i hate being on my own. 
and everyone can see that, i really fell,
 and i'm going through hell.
thinking about you with somebody else.
somebody wants you, 
somebody needs you. 
somebody dreams about you every single night. 
somebody cant breathe, 
without you its lonely.
somebody hopes that some day you will see, 
that somebody's me.
that somebody's me.
yeaa...
how, 
how did we go wrong? 
it was so good, and now its gone.
and i pray at night, that our passing will cross. 
what we hide, isn't lost.
cause you are always driving in my thoughts..
somebody wants you, 
somebody needs you.
somebody dreams about you every single night.
somebody can't breathe, 
without you it's lonely.
somebody hopes that some day you'll see, 
that somebody's me. 
oh yeah.
you will always be in my life, 
even if i'm not in your life.
cause you're in my memory.
 you, 
when you remember me?
..and before you set me free, 
oh listen please...
somebody wants you, 
somebody needs you.
somebody dreams about you every single night. 
somebody can't breathe, 
without you it's lonely.
somebody hopes that someday you will see, 
that somebody's me. 
that somebody's me. 
that somebody's me.
 that somebody's me. 
oh yea..</td>

Lyrics By : Manav (Yuvraj)
 
I don't know why
You want to follow me tonight
When the rest of the world
With whom I've crossed and I've quarreled
Let's me down so
For a thousand reasons that I know
To share forever the unrest
With all the demons I possess
Beneath the silver moon
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
Eighth and Ocean Drive
With all the vampires and their brides
We're all bloodless and blind
And longing for a life
Beyond the silver moon
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon
So far away &#8211; so outer space
I've trashed myself &#8211; I've lost my way
I've got to get to you
I've got to get to you
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon
Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't want to fight
I'm tired of being sorry
I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon</td>

I try to tell you how I feel
I try to tell you but I&#8217;m weak
Words don&#8217;t come easily
When you get close I shiver
I watch you when you smile
I watch you when you cry
And I still don&#8217;t understand
I can&#8217;t find the way to tell you
I wish I was your lover
I wish that you were mine
Baby I got this feeling
That I just can&#8217;t hide
Don&#8217;t try to run away
There&#8217;s many things I wanna say
No matter how it ends
Just hold me when I tell you
I wish I was your lover

Baby I got this feeling
That I just can&#8217;t hide
I wish I was your lover
I wish that you were mine

She walks with a smile
she&#8217;s so full of life
But she cries in the night
Just to tryin to hold on
No one can hear her
She&#8217;s all alone
This little girl 
closes her eyes
all that she wants
is someone to love
Someone to love
Little girl
She&#8217;s all grown up
Oh she&#8217;s getting famous
she&#8217;s a big star
Oh little girl
Fights with her mom
Can&#8217;t believe money
Changed who she loved
And she cries in the night
Just to trying to hold on
But no one can hear her
She&#8217;s all alone
This little girl 
closes her eyes
all that she wants
is someone to love
oh yeah
Someone to love
she cries in the night

 they say love is just a game
they say time can heal the pain
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
and i guess i'm just a fool
i keep holding on to you
i told you once you were the one
you know that i'd die for you
Although it hurts to see you go
oh this time you should know
i won't try to stop you
don't you forget about me baby
don't you forget about me now
some day you'll turn around and ask me, 
why did i let you go
so you try to fake a smile
you don't wanna break my heart
i can see that you're afraid
but baby its too late
coz I'm already dying
dont you forget about me baby
dont you forget about me now
some day you'll turn around and ask me, 
why did i let you go
dont you forget about me baby
dont you forget about me now
some day you'll turn around and ask me, 
why did i let you go
dont you forget about me baby
dont you forget about me now
some day you'll turn around and ask me, 
why did i let you go
why did i let you go

If I will it all away

Don't turn away

Don't try to hide

Don't turn out the light

But somehow I know that there's much more to come
Immobilized by my fear
And soon to be blinded by tears

I can stop the pain

If I will it all away

Don't turn out the light

Fallen angels at my feet
Whispered voices at my ear
Death before my eyes
Lying next to me, I fear

She beckons me, shall I give in?
Upon my end shall it begin
Forsaking all I've fallen for
I rise to meet the end

Don't turn away
(Don't give in to the pain)
Don't try to hide
(Though they're screaming your name)

Don't close your eyes

And I feel perfectly fine

But I've been screamin' and fightin'
And kissin' in the rain
And it's two a.m. and I'm cursin' your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a roller-coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space and never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing, and I'm comfortable

He can't see the smile I'm fakin'
And my heart's not breakin'
'Cause I'm not feelin' anything at all

And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I'll be screamin' and fightin'
And kissin' in the rain
It's two a.m. and I'm cursin' your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look now, the
sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so
mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough
away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their
names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me
stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better
than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven
dwarfs
And Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole
wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm takin' this chance to
say
That I had the best day with you today

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To explain, in due time
All I know; time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

Didn't look out below
Watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far

I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth, instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action these words were never true
Now I find myself in question (They point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association (You point the finger at me again)

I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth, instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door and open up my mind

I'm gonna run away and never say goodbye
(Gonna run away, gonna run away)
(Gonna run away, gonna run away)
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why
(Gonna run away, gonna run away)
(Gonna run away, gonna run away)
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind
(Gonna run away, gonna run away) (Mind)
(Gonna run away, gonna run away) (Mind)
(Gonna run away, gonna run away) (Mind)
(Gonna run away, gonna run away)

I wanna run away, never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth, instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers, no more lies
I wanna shut the door, and open up my mind

I wanna run away (And open up my mind)
I wanna run away (And open up my mind)
I wanna run away (And open up my mind)
I wanna run away and open up my mind</td>

Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this loud

Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself

(Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blind leaves you senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
And if I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself

(Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid, I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?

Don't you (Know?)
I can't tell you how to make it (Go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (Try)
I can't seem to convince myself (Why)
I'm stuck on the outside

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs

So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck

But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cut, that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm 'aight)

In the hood, in L.A., they saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla, in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold

I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill' out the deal and I'm still in the grind
Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go (okay)

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?

When my jaws get to bumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned

I'm-a tell you what Banks told me 'cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
Or we go upside they head wit' a bottle of bub
They know where we fuckin' be

You find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed

And when she'd go by - She'd light up the sky like the sun coming up.

She be standin' by the bus stop - Driver opened up the door,
I'd just sit n' watch her - Gettin' on the 104,
I wanna give her my number - I wanna tell her my name,
Wanna climb on board that cross-town bus,
Take a chance she feels the same.

I fell under her spell,
(It's just another East Side story.)

Some things you hold on to - n' some you just let go,
It seems like the ones that you can't have are the ones you want the most,
I think about her sometimes - I wonder if she was real,
And if I ever find her I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

It's just another East Side story,
Everybody's got a tale to tell,
Like a hundred guys before me,

Yeah, her spell.

Still the same old story - Still the same old game,
Up there on the East Side - Life goes on the same,
She never knew my number - Never even knew my name,
She climbed on board that cross-town bus I never saw her again.

Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hearable
What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy
Lifeless
To know the definition for what life is
Priceless
For you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?

Possess you with one go

The essence the basics
Without it you make it
Allow me to make this
Child, like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child and beast
Every cloud you see
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion heprovides
with me as a guide
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing, remember
(that it's all in your head)

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

Artist: Chamillionaire
They see me rollin'
They hatin'
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
My music so loud;
I'm swangin'.
They hopin'
That they gon' catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' 
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

Police think they can see me lean;
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen.
For me to see me ride by, they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen.
Ride with a new chick, she like "Hold up."
Next to the Playstation controller
There's a full clip in my pistola;
Turn a jacker into a coma.
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone;
Just tryin' to make you horny, ain't tryin' to have no babies.
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies.
Law's on patrol; you know they hate me.
Music turned all the way up and to the maximum;
I can speak for some niggas tryin' to jack for some.
But we packin' somethin' that we have
And, um, will have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell. I'm grippin' oak.
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow.
Twins steady twistin' like hit this dough;
Pull up from behind and im sittin low.
Windows down, gotta stop pollution.
CDs change; niggas like "Who is that producin'?"
This the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston
But I still ain't losin'.

They see me rollin';
They hatin'.
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
My music so loud;
I'm swangin'.
They hopin'
That they gon' catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

I been drinkin' and smokin'; holdin' shit
'Cause a brother can't focus.
I gotta get to home 'fore the po-po's scope
This big ol Excursion
Swervin',
All up in the curve, man.
Nigga been sippin' on that Hennessey
And the gin again
Is in again;
We in the wind.
Doin' a hundred while I come from the block
And rollin another one up;
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck.
I got a revolver in my right hand;
40 oz on my lap, freezing my balls
Roll a nigga tree, green leaves and all.
Comin' up pretty deep, me and my do-jo.
I gotta get to backstreets;
Wanted by the six-pounds
And I got heat.
shots to the block;
We creep-creep. Pop-pop.
Hope cops don't see me;
On a low key.
With no regard for the law,
We dodge 'em like fuck-'em-all.
But I won't get caught up
And brought up
On charges for none of y'all.
Keep a gun in car
And a blunt to spark,
But, well, if you want,
Nigga,poppin'you dark.
Ready or not, we gon' bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire.

They see me rollin';
They hatin'.
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
My music so loud;
I'm swangin'.
They hopin'
That they gon' catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.

Do what you thinkin' so,
I tried to let you go.
Turn on my blinker light
And then I swang it slow.
And they upset for sure
'Cause they think they know
That they catchin me with plenty of the drinkin' drough.
So they get behind me,
Tryin' to check my tags.
Look at my rearview and they smilin',
Thinkin' they'll catch me on the wrong; keep tryin'
'Cause they denyin' it's racial profilin'.
Houston, TX, you can check my tags;
Pull me over, try to check my slab.
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast.
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them,
Givin' a damn 'bout not feeling my attitude.
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood.
I'ma laugh at you
And then I have to cruise.
You're a number two
On some old DJ Screw.
You can't arrest me plus you can't sue.
This a message to the law; tells 'em "We hate you."
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known.
Tippin' down; I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome.
Bookin' my phone; findin' a chick I wanna bone.
Like they couldn't stop me I'mma bout to pull up at your home
And it's on.

They see me rollin';
They hatin'.
Patrollin'
And tryin. to catch me ridin. dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
My music so loud;
I'm swangin'.
They hopin'
That they gon' catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
Yo.

We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say "I love you," enough
Till it's too late, it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you, what would you wish you would've done?

Yeah, we gotta stop
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given if
This is all we got then we gotta stop thinking that
Every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day
To turn it all around or throw it all away
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say,
Gotta live like we're dying

And if you plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
So when we long for absolution, there'll be no one on the line

Like we're dying (x4)

You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till its head on
Why we think we're right when we're dead wrong,
You never know a good thing till it's gone

Like we're dying (x4)</td>

I ain't never seen nuthin that'll make me go, 
this crazy all night spendin my dough 
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go 
Dem birthday cakes, they stole the show 
So sexual, she was flexible 
Professional, drinkin X and ooo 
Hold up wait a minute, do i see what I think I 
Whoa 
Did I think I seen shorty get low 
Ain't the same when it's up that close 
Make it rain, I'm makin it snow 
Work the pole, I got the bank roll 
Imma say that I prefer them no clothes 
I'm into that, I love women exposed 
She threw it back at me, I gave her more 
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes 
She had them 

[Chorus:]
 
Apple Bottom Jeans [Jeans] 
Boots with the fur [With the fur] 
The whole club was lookin at her 
She hit the flo [She hit the flo] 
Next thing you know 
Shawty got low low low low low low low low 
Them baggy sweat pants 
And the Reeboks with the straps [With the straps] 
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack [Ayy] 
She hit the flo [She hit the flo] 
Next thing you know 
Shawty got low low low low low low low low 

[Verse 2:]
 
Hey 
Shawty what I gotta do to get you home 
My jeans full of gwap 
And they ready for Shones 
Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown 
Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan 
One stack (come on) 
Two stacks (come on) 
Three stacks (come on, now that's three grand) 
What you think I'm playin baby girl 
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands 
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder 
I knew it was ova, that Henny and Cola 
Got me like a Soldier 
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her 
So lucky oo me, I was just like a clover 
Shorty was hot like a toaster 
Sorry but I had to fold her, 
Like a pornography poster 
She showed her 

[Chorus:]
 
Apple Bottom Jeans [Jeans] 
Boots with the fur [With the fur] 
The whole club was lookin at her 
She hit the flo [She hit the flo] 
Next thing you know 
Shawty got low low low low low low low low

And the Reeboks with the straps [With the straps] 
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack [Ayy] 
She hit the flo [She hit the flo]

Shawty got low low low low low low low low 

[Verse 3:]
 
Whoa 
Shawty 
Yea she was worth the money 
Lil mama took my cash, 
and I ain't want it back, 
The way she bit that rag, 
got her them paper stacks, 
Tattoo Above her crack, 
I had to handle that, 
I was on it, sexy woman, let me shownin 
They be want it two in the mornin 
I'm zonin in them rosay bottles foamin 
She wouldn't stop, made it drop 
Shorty did that pop and lock, 
Had to break her off that gwap 
Gah it was fly just like my glock

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

My, my, my music hits me so hard
Makes me say "Oh, my Lord"
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet

It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oak town
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy
(You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know
(You can't touch this)

Look at my eyes, man
(You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
(You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now, you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat

While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that

Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

Yo, I told you
(You can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man?
(You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka
(You can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' about the Hammer, you talkin' about a show

That's hype and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the nineties to burn

The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
You can't touch this, you can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Go with the funk, it is said
If you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead

So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair

This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump

Yeah
(You can't touch this)
Look, man
(You can't touch this)

You better get hype, boy
Because you know you can't
(You can't touch this)b
Ring the bell, school's back in

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic

Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo, Hammer"
And the rest can go and play

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Yeah, you can't touch this
I told you, you can't touch this
Too hype, can't touch this
Get way outta here, you can't touch this</td>

You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back</td>

Milo....
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it&#161;&#175;s like 
to be hated
To be faded 
to telling only lies
As my conscious seems to be
But my dreams they aren&#161;&#175;t as empty
I have hours, only lonely
As my conscious seems to be
My love is vengeance
I have hours, only lonely
That&#161;&#175;s never free
My love is vengeance
No one knows what its like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
and I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain woe
Can show through
That&#161;&#175;s never free
&#206;&#210;&#210;&#187;&#214;&#177;&#212;&#218;&#215;&#183;&#203;&#230;&#215;&#197;&#203;&#251;

Where is my milo.....
Where is my love.....
No one knows what its like
To be mistreated
to be defeated
Behind blue eyes
And no one know how to say
That they&#161;&#175;re sorry
and don&#161;&#175;t worry
I&#161;&#175;m not telling lies
But my dreams they aren&#161;&#175;t as empty
But my dreams they aren&#161;&#175;t as empty
As my conscious seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That&#161;&#175;s never free
No one knows what it&#161;&#175;s like
No one knows what it&#161;&#175;s like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
I wish it was
all than easy
I wish I wish
I wish I wish
I wish it was
all than easy
where is my milo&#163;&#191;.....
Where is my love&#163;&#191;.....

Have you ever noticed,
That I&#8217;m not acting as I used to do before?
Have you ever wondered,
Why I always keep on coming back for more?
What have you done to me,
I&#8217;ll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
I&#8217;ll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
I&#8217;ll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
You really are my ecstasy,
my real life fantasy, oh yeah.
You really are my ecstasy,
my real life fantasy, oh yeah.
Not that I&#8217;m complaining,
A more beautiful vision - I have never seen
If you don&#8217;t mind me saying,
A lifelong ambition to fulfill my dream
What have you done to me,
I&#8217;ll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
I&#8217;ll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
I&#8217;ll never be the same I'll tell you for sure
You really are my ecstasy,
my real life fantasy, oh yeah.
You really are my ecstasy,
my real life fantasy, oh yeah.
You really are my ecstasy,
(There can be no other
While we still have each other)
my real life fantasy, oh yeah.
(There can be no other
While we still have each other)

Feel the earth move

Hear my heart burst
again.

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt
this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Or face it all 
together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Or face it all together
At skyfall

Is at skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
When worlds collide, and days are dark
You may have my number, 
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all... together

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all together
At skyfall
(let the sky fall)

(When it crumbles)

(We will stand tall)

(let the sky fall)

(When it crumbles)

(We will stand tall)

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know i'd never be me
without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all... together
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all together
At skyfall
LET THE SKY FALL!

We will stand tall...

Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is, where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Yeah
Oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries
Are outside the lines
We've been conditioned
To not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, oh

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Oh, oh

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words
That you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten

They'll be the King of Hearts, and you're the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers

Honey from the hive
Music in my mind

Like wildflowers in my room
I love the way you move me

We'd listen to her mix tapes; Dead Can Dance, Felt, This Mortal Coil...
She introduced me to her favourite books, gave me clothes, and my first cigarette
Sometimes we would head down to Blackbirds moor to watch the barges on Grand Union in the twilight
She said "The water has no memory"
For a few months everything about our lives was perfect
It was only us, we were inseparable
But gradually she passed into another distant part of my memory
Until I could no longer remember her face, her voice, even her name

We have got, we have got the perfect life</td>

There was sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed

And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way
When you love someone
Yeah, really love someone

Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up till deep in the night
There's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you tenderly

Gutter ka pani peelo
Kabhi na kabhi to peelo
Me hoon hero tu hai zero

[Rapverse1 (Waqas)]

Don't even go there kid you know I'm out of your damn reach
Your talk is cheap at least I practice what I teach
And when all systems fail you return to the beats
But got nothing to say, the chosen one for defeat
And I spot you in the crowd while I flash in the spotlight
How you wish you could be more like me and bust over beats tight
And reach out to these kids 'cause when I speak you know they listen
I paid the king a visit now he delivers pizza in prison
You said I was bizarre don't watch stars mob floors
You see I was hardcore if you gave me less I made it more
But f*ck that one love baby let's hit for that cheddar
Basically we the same I just make it look better

[Chorus]

[Rapverse2 (Lenny)]

Toma del arroyo de los celos, perros
Te lo digo en la lengua de mi amigo, peelo
Te duele toda rima que yo escribo, y sigo
Siendo en estos montes yo el mero, mero
Hijo de la gran p***
Un momento, respeto a la madre tuya
Porque eres tu quien es la puta
Pobrecito toma mi rima y mis contratos
Quieres estar en mis zapatos
En la supuesta rampa de la fama
No vendas la carne antes mata la vaca
No estas listo nino
Para una guerra verbal
Es a mi al que siempre te van a comparar

[Translation:]

Drink of the rivulet of jealousy, dogs

Now I'll say it in his native tongue, peelo
You hurting by every single rhyme I write, and I keep
Been in this countryside the f*cking one
Son of a b****
Hold it!! Respect to your mama
Coz it is you who's the bitch
Poor little thing, here you have my rhyme and my contracts
You want to be in my shoes
In the so-called spotlight
You know you can't sell the meat before killing the cow
You ain't ready kid
To a verbal war
It will always be me who you gonna be compare to

[Chorus]

[Rapverse3 (Isam)]

You claim that I'm a mammas boy
Cuz I don't smoke or drink alcohol
She claims that I'm criminal like last weeks thief at the mall
Some say I don't sound like hip hop suppose to sound
Ain't got no L.A, N.Y, Dirty South type of sound
That's what I'm trying say
I was born and raised here
Let the Source Magazine cross the sea and represent here
Tell them how we felt the day Pac got shot
While they were screaming pour some liquor
We prayed all night in the mosque
Tell them how best "pop of the year" is "rap of the year"
f*ck being nominated 6 times give me "rock the year"
Ask Jay-B, he'll tell ya, no stormy weather
Not even the ugliest typhoon could ruin this set up
I was laughing, TZZZ!!! All the way to the bank
Changed the whole game based on a pop album prank
Hell next year for the fun of it
We do it again, again and again

You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back</td>

Folks
I'd like to sing a song about the American Dream
About me
About you
About the way our American hearts beat way down in the bottoms of our chests
About that special feeling we get in the cockles of our hearts
Or maybe below the cockles
Maybe in the sub-cockle area
Maybe in the liver
Maybe in the kidneys
Maybe even in the colon
We don't know

I'm just a regular joe
With a regular job
I'm your average white
Suburbanite slob
I like football, and porno, and books about war
I've got an average house
With a nice hardwood floor
My wife, and my job
My kids, and my car
My feet on the table
And a Cuban cigar
But sometimes that just ain't enough
To keep a man like me interested
Oh no, no way, uh uhh
No, I gotta go out and have fun
At someone else's expense
Oh yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

I drive really slow
In the ultra-fast lane
While people behind me are going insane

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, such an asshole)

I use public toilets
And I piss on the seat
I walk around in the summer time sayin', "How about this heat?"

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's the worlds biggest asshole)

Sometimes I park in the handicapped spaces
While handicapped people
Make handicapped faces

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's a real fucking asshole)

Maybe I shouldn't be singin' this song
Ranting and raving and carrying on
Maybe they're right when they tell me I'm wrong...
...
NAAAHHHHH!

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's the world's biggest asshole)

You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get myself a 1967 Cadilac El Dorado Convertable
Hot pink!
With whale skin hub caps
An all leather cow interior
And big brown baby seal eyes for headlights
YEAH!
And I'm gonna drive around in that baby
At 115 miles per hour
Getting one mile per gallon
Sucking down Quarter Pounder cheeseburgers from McDonalds in the old-fashioned non-biodegradable Styrofoam containers
And when I'm done sucking down those grease-ball burgers
I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag
And then I'm gonna toss the Styrofoam containers right out the side
And there ain't a Goddamn thing anybody can do about it
You know why?
'Cause we got the bombs, that's why!
Two words: Nuclear Fuckin' Weapons
Okay!?
Russia, Germany, Romania
They can have all the Democracy they want
They can have a big Democracy cake walk
Right through the middle of Tienemen Square
And it won't make a lick of difference
Because we got the bombs
Okay!?
John Wayne's not dead
He's frozen!
And as soon as we find a cure for cancer We're gonna thaw out "The Duke"
And he's gonna be pretty pissed off
You know why?
Have you ever taken a cold shower?
Well, multiply that by 15 million times
That's how pissed off "The Duke"'s gonna be
I'm gonna get "The Duke"
And John Cassavetes
And Lee Marvin
And Sam Peckinpah
And a case of whiskey
And drive down to Texas
And-
(Hey, Hey! You know you really are an asshole)
Why don't you just shut-up and sing the song, pal?
You know, the whole time I thought I was that asshole
And it turns out it was him
What an asshole!

I'm an asshole
(he's an asshole, what an asshole)
I'm an asshole
(he's the worlds biggest asshole)

Yo, haven&#8217;t you really tried to be a playa
Hey you aint no playa
Walkin with an unloaded gun

And after dark you&#8217;re gone

You know the one where they figure out your child support rate
You might be a raise
But remember I aint caged
I&#8217;m an underage
And you&#8217;re not the only one that&#8217;s crazed
So leave your Dr. Dre&#8217;s
And your empty A-K&#8217;s
Bring your microphone and your pale face
Bring your daughter
Be prepared when she asks, &#8220;Yo dada, why you let that man out rap your ass?&#8221;
Yo slim shady
Yea, you the real shady
But your married wife
Acting like she still a single lady
So the real slim shady needs to shut the fuck up
Cause the last I&#8217;d heard you had got locked up
So to slim shady
This once for you baby
There&#8217;s still cats on the mic that can
Out rap you daily
The real slim shady take back your platinum
Placks
And shove them up your flat platinum ass biatch!</td>

I'm just too white and nerdy
Really, really white and nerdy

First in my class there at MIT
Got skills, I'm a champion at D&amp;D
MC Escher, that's my favorite MC
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin - to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library
My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin' for my Top 8 spaces
Yo, I know pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills, but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper, I could play for days
Once you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast, I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer app I haven't run
At Pascal, well, I'm number one
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat, but I got a soldering gun
"Happy Days" is my favorite theme song
I could sure kick your butt at a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon
Here's the part I sing on

They see me roll on my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't ya see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I'd like to roll with the gangsters
Although it's apparent I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy?

I've been browsin', inspectin'
X-Men comics, you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shoppin' online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized "Holy Grail" really well
I can recite it right now and have you ROTFLOL
I got a business doin' websites
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all
Even made a home page for my dog
Yo, I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin' a sale down at The Gap
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop pop, hope no one sees me gettin' freaky
I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
I was in A/V Club and Glee Club and even the chess team
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was, do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Faire
Got my name on my underwear

They see me strollin' they laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy
I wanna bowl with the gangsters
But oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy

Guess the champ got too lazy
Ain't gonna fly now, he's just takin' up space
Sold his gloves, threw his eggs down the drain
But he's no bum, he works down the street
He bought the neighborhood deli
Back on his feet, now he's choppin' up meat
Come inside, maybe you'll hear him say:

[Chorus 1:]
Try the rye or the kaiser
They're on special tonight
If you want, you can have an appetizer
You might like our salami, and the liver's all right
And they'd really go well with the rye
Or the kaiser

[Verse 2:]
Never eats while on the job
He heard it's good to stay hungry
But he makes a pretty mean shish kabob
Have a taste, they were made fresh today

[Chorus 2:]
Try the rye or the kaiser or the wheat or the white
Maybe I can suggest an appetizer
Stay away from the tuna, it smells funny tonight
But you just can't go wrong with the rye
Or the kaiser

[Verse 3:]
So today, his deli comes first
Still he dreams of his past days of glory
Goes in the back and beats up on the liverwurst
All the while you can still hear him say:

[Chorus 3:]
It's the rye or the kaiser, it's the thrill of one bite
Let me please be your catering advisor
If you want substitutions, I won't put up a fight
You can have your roast beef on the rye
Or the kaiser

Pizza party at your house,
I went just to check it out.
19 extra larges,
What a shame, no one came.
Just us, eatin' all alone,
You said take the pizza home.
No sense lettin' all this go to waste,
So then I faced

Pizza all day, and everyday, there's cheese round the clock,
It's gettin' me blocked, And I sure don't care, for
irregularity.

Tell me,
Why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
Cos' right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated,
In the bathroom.
I sit and I wait and I strain and I sweat and I clench and I
feel the pain
Oh, should've taken laxatives or had my colon irrigated.
No, no, no.

I was feelin' pretty down,
'Til my girlfriend came around.
We're just so alike in every way, I gotta say.
In fact, I just thought I might,
pop the question there that night.
I was kissing her so tenderly,
But woe is me.

Who would have guessed, her family crest.
I suddenly spy, tattoo'd on her thigh.
And son of a gun, it's just like the one on me.
Tell me.

How was I supposed to know we were both related?
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin we never would have
dated.
What to do now?
Should I go ahead and propose and get hitched and have kids with
11 toes,
And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated.
No, no, no.

(no no no)

Ooh, I had so much on my mind,
I thought maybe I'd unwind.
Try out that new roller coaster ride,
And the guide...

Said not to stand, but that's a demand,
That I couldn't meet, I got on my feet,
And stood up instead and knocked off my head you see.
Tell me.

Why'd I have to go and get myself decapitated?
This really is a major inconvenience, oh man I really hate it.
It's such a drag now.
I can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore, I can't belch or
yodel anymore,
Can't spit or blow my nose or even read Sports Illustrated.
Oh no!

Why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated?
I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated.
What a bummer.
I can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeze.
But my neck is enjoying a pleasant breeze now.
Haven't been the same since my head and I were separated.

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick - ha ha!
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin

(Swifty)
Bitch it's too late

(Eminem)
Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

(Swifty)
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin, creatin murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face {*BLAM*}
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin every penny - it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin, I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin me they bracelets
Chillin in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin - throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

(Eminem)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit

Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

(Bizarre)
I'm a compulsive liar, settin my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?) Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*}
Lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*}
Lettin the record skip. {*needle pops*} (Damn!)
{*DJ reverses the record and scratches it back on beat*}
I'm fuckin anything when I'm snortin
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
{*dog whines*} Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin ass mom

(Proof)
Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin {*gun cocks*} nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin, get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
and found chopped up in a trash bag

(Kuniva)
We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell
cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a "Luni"
I got a "Yukmouth" and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin "Kuniva yo yo."
I leave ya face leakin, run up in church
and smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon

(Kon Artis)
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
(Special delivery!) I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin in dough

(Eminem)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

(Eminem)
Haha. suck my motherfuckin dick
D-12. Dirty motherfuckin Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre Kid
Swifty McVeigh

[Big Bank Hank]
I'm Big Bank, I am the Chief
I got a lot of raps but I'll be real
I never need a horse I like to chill
so I, drive up in my new Seville
My Tribe went down in the hall of fame
Cause I'm the one who shot Jesse James
Pound for pound, I will never break down
(Big Bank!) No sir, I don't mess around

Awowowowowowowowowow!! Ho!
Wowowowowowwowowowowowowowowowowow!!

[Chorus]

[Master G]
Like Kemosabi, of course it's me
I'm better known as the Master G
A firing squad, sensed the danger
When they're stung by the rapping ranger
Had a little talk with my medicine man
He said, "Get them squaws, fast as you can"
To all you girls, that wanna join my Tribe
Just move to my rhythm, and feel my vibe
Put up a fuss, in the end you'll agree
When you come inside, my tee-pee
As I said before, you could sense the danger

When you're stung by the rapping ranger
When Silver and I, take a ride
All you suckers better step aside
I sting squaws, then I run away
HIYOO Silver, is what I say!

Ho! Ho! Wowowowowowowowow!
Hit it gang!

Ho! Ho! Ho! Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!

[Chorus]

[Wonder Mike]
A pow-wow, just rock it out
Finger poppin to the break of dawn
Keep it rockin like the stuff that we call maize
(What's that?) Hot buttered popcorn
You just hippa-hoppa-dippa-boppa bang the boogie
woogie betcha wanna boogie again
And you can put me to the test at your request
I rock you out of your mocassins
Kemosabi got down, took off his mask
He kicked off his shoes and did the Monster Mash
Tommy came along, saw what was happenin
His head began to boppin his foot start to clappin
Go slam, dunk, do the jerk
And with the mic is how my smoke signals work
They were jammin' off a record that said it best:
"Now what you hear is not a test!"

Aowowowowowowowowowowowo!
A-hunga-hunga-hunga-hunga (2X)

When he wants to get down
But when he comes out of his hole
He sounds something like this

Oh, that's funky, that's funky
Like nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky
Come on wit' it again, fellas
Come on wit' it
All through all the land, yeah yeah
Sing it
He plays in a band
Plays in a band
Plays guitar without any hands
Pretty good, I might add
Yeah
When he grabs his guitar and starts to pluck
Everybody wants to get up and dance

Ah, get it baby

I'm his manager, heh, yeah
Gonna make a million dollars
I get it all too, he can't spend it
Don't stop now honey, get down

That's it, that's it
Don't, don't,
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight it

Kind to some, but not to thee
Born with a rare and sad disease
She grew &#8212; a ham &#8212; where her head should be
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
Her dream was to be a famous star
But at the rate she was goin', she wasn't going fa-a-ar
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Her father was a simple man (Duh!)
He wanted to help, "in any way that I can!"
Home from school, he watched his daughter cry
In the yard, he cursed God and fired at the sky
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
Her dreams in the sky, her father felt her pain
And as he shot at the clouds, it began to rain
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Got a call from the doctor
He had some amazing news for her
He just developed a cure
If she hurried over now, he'd try it out on her
Burst out the door, she was beaming
Among the raindrops her happy tears were streaming
Finally freed from her pain
But something else fell with the rain
A stray bullet shot by her father
Aimlessly nested inside her
She fell to the the sidewalk, now empty
Of the life which once christened her body
"Nurse, s-she's... she's gone."
"O-oh... oh dear."
"I left a lunch on the table in the operating room for the bereaved, a cooked ham, as is customary for these... dark situations."
"U-uh, Doctor, what... which one is the... which... which one is the ham that&#8212;?"
"I-I must... I must go... I must... I must go, I'm on break."
"Oh dear."
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
At her time of death
The doc said "time to eat!"
So we took a bite out of her face meat
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore (La-la-oh...)
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Soaring infinitely through space
Hamantha's soul was graced
With a glance of our humble planet
At which she was amazed
The news of her untimely death
Had spread out near and far
And through her soul, the truth was whole
The dream had crossed the bar
Hamantha had become a star
Hamantha was finally a star
Hamantha had become a star
Hamantha was finally a star</td>

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb</td>

High Hopes

Music by Gilmour  

Lyrics by Gilmour / Samson 

&#184;&#232;&#180;&#202;&#214;&#198;&#215;&#247;:&#200;&#203;&#214;&#174;&#179;&#245;

High Hopes&#213;&#226;&#202;&#215;&#184;&#232;&#202;&#199;Pink Floyd&#181;&#196;&#215;&#168;&#188;&#173;Division Bell&#192;&#239;&#181;&#196;&#181;&#218;11&#202;&#215;

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever

Forward he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
And the General sat, and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down
And in the end, it's only round and round and round

Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

..I mean they're gonna kill ya. So like, if you give 'em a quick, sh.. short, sharp, shock, they don't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off light, 'cos I could've given him a thrashing, I only hit him once.  It's only a difference of right and wrong innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they, eh?

Down and out
It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about 

Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died</td>

Blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend,
You martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon,
You cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night,
And exposed to the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome
With random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper,
You prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and
I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child,
You winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion,

Title: Within You Without You
Album: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

We were talking,

About the space between us all.

And the people,

Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion.

Never glimpse the truth,

Then it's far too late,

When they pass away.

We were talking,

About the love we all could share,

When we find it.

To try our best to hold it there,

With our love, with our love, we could save the world,

If they only knew.

Try to realize it's all within yourself; no one else can make you change.

And to see you're really only very small,
And life flows on within you and without you.

We were talking,

About the love that's gone so cold.

And the people,

Who gain the world and lose their soul.

They don't know,

They can't see,

Are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself,
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there.

And the time will come when you see we're all one,
And life flows on within you and without you.

Yeah... Ha Ha!
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cos I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hearable
What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy
Lifeless
To know the definition for what life is
Priceless
For you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?
Gunsmokin' righteous with one token
Psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless,but not for long

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence the basics
Without it you make it
Allow me to make this
Child, like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child and beast
Every cloud you see
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion heprovides
with me as a guide
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing, remember
(that it's all in your head)

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before, I knew you

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch

And Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?

And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat

Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much

You talkin' about the Hammer, you talkin' about a show

That's hype and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the nineties to burn

The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
You can't touch this, you can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Go with the funk, it is said
If you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead

So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair

This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump

The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic

Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo, Hammer"
And the rest can go and play

(Hey!)
Let's live it up

(Let's live it up)
I got my money
(My pay)
Let's spend it up
(Let's spend it up)

Go out and smash it
(Smash it)
Like oh my God
(Like oh my God)
Jump off that sofa
(Come on!)
Let's get, get off

Fill up my cup
(Drink)
Mozoltov
(Lahyme)
Look at her dancing
(Move it, move it)
Just take it off

Let's paint the town
(Paint the town)
We'll shut it down
(Let's shut it down)
Let's burn the roof
And then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, do it, do it, do it

Here we come, here we go, we gotta rock
(Rock rock rock rock rock)
Easy come, easy go, now we on top
(Top top top top top)
Feel the shot, body rock, rock it, don't stop
(Stop stop stop stop stop)
Round and round, up and down, around the clock
(Rock rock rock rock rock)

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
(Do it!)
Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday
(Do it!)
Get, get, get, get, get with us, you know what we say, say
Party every day, p-p-p-party every day

And I'm feelin', woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

I gotta feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Woohoo

I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?

And I hope that you are havin' the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice

Come on now who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you
think you are, ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control

well,
I think you're Crazy
I think you're Crazy
I think you're Crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to live their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them.

Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And there's no considence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm Crazy
Maybe you're Crazy
Maybe we're Crazy
Probably!

And now we hate where these beds be
Took nothing at all to part this red sea
I'm a shackled child
Singing the good song of freedom
They've got no pride
They interrupt our grieving
Tear drops dropping
For the pain of the world
My best friend dies
When she was just a young girl
Left me here, to fend for myself
Now the pain never leaves
We just learn to cope
So when the devil needs hanging
Will you tie up the rope and shout pull
Let's put an end to this bull
Zen thing
How many years
Before we practice what we preach
How many tears
Before we truly clinch the peak
Only to find that
There is no honey on the moon
Official goon
With the unofficial croon

I'm all things to all men
All of the women
All the children
Just say when
And I'll take you to my Tardis
Who's the hardest
Who's the hardest

16 bar cycles
Heart felt recital
From the wacky blacky man
They should have called me Michael
Look at the monster you make
Look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
'Cause it's each to his self
In these times that we live
Does god have a sense of humor
Then the joke's on us
'Cause we're chasing our tails
For how long
The tussle makes us how strong
Vintage poor people fun
If we could ease up
On these booze and fags
Then, just maybe
Life wouldn't seem so mad
Be a man my dad said
But what the hell he know
He lost his dreams
He lost his flow
And I don't wanna be alone
I'm born king
So where's my throne
I'm too intense
I'm too deep
I'm too nice for life
So what makes this place so nervous?

(4x)
I'm all things to all men
All of the women
All the children
Just say when
And I'll take you to my Tardis
Who's the hardest
Who's the hardest

Look at the monster you make
Look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
But you claim not
We're searching for Jesus
But I'll be damned
If I'll be crucified by ten thousand spies
Compulsive lies
They hate me
They love me
They hate me

'Cause I'm all things to all men, all of the women, all the children
Just say when and I'll take you to my Tardis

Threatened by shadows at night and exposed in the light

Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!</td>

Music by Gilmour  

Lyrics by Gilmour / Samson 

&#184;&#232;&#180;&#202;&#214;&#198;&#215;&#247;:&#200;&#203;&#214;&#174;&#179;&#245;

High Hopes&#213;&#226;&#202;&#215;&#184;&#232;&#202;&#199;Pink Floyd&#181;&#196;&#215;&#168;&#188;&#173;Division Bell&#192;&#239;&#181;&#196;&#181;&#218;11&#202;&#215;

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever

Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Breathe Reprise

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire

Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell</td>

Moved from side to side

Black and blue

Haven't you heard it's a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

..I mean they're gonna kill ya. So like, if you give 'em a quick, sh.. short, sharp, shock, they don't do it again. Dig it? I mean he get off light, 'cos I could've given him a thrashing, I only hit him once.  It's only a difference of right and wrong innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they, eh?

Down and out
It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about 

Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice

Now starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can

And no-one calls us to move on
And no-one forces down our eyes
No-one speaks and no-one tries
No-one flies around the sun

Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no-one sings me lullabies
And no-one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky</td>

What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream 
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!

And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old</td>

Do you want to love me more?

Is cursed by the same thing that nurtured its shame, is it worth all the work?

Have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
Have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain)

Do you want to be afraid? (No, I don't want to feel pain)

Oh delight in the window I couldn't be at rest

It wasn't safe to breathe at all (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
Oh I know it wasn't safe (It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)

I never meant to lead you on
I only meant to please me, however

And then you tell me, "Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more together
Boy, we can do much more together"

I'm nothing but a selfish man
I'm nothing but a privileged peddler
And did you think I'd stay the night?
And did you think I'd love you forever?

And then you tell me, "Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more
Boy, we can do much more together
Boy, we can do much more together"

I gotta tell you girl, I want nothing less
Girl, I want nothing less

All of the power invested in me
Be it hard to love my enemies.
All of the black bags over the heads of the dead and dying.
The more I understand about the human race
The less I comprehend about our purpose and place
And maybe if there was a clearer line the curiosity would satisfy.
Time based prophecies that kept me from living
In the moment I am struggling
To trust the divinity of all the guides
And what the hell they have planned for us.
I cry for the creatures who get left behind
But everything will change in a blink of an eye
And if you wish to survive
You will find the guide inside.
I go back and forth every single day
The clarity that comes to me in a choppy way
As the feelings
And the places
And the seasons change
The galaxies remain.
Energy fields cone the body in space.
The angels that are coming from a spiritual waste.
The hate that gets me distant from my spiritual pace.
Ten fold the manna when the planets are in place, in polar alignment.
We're on assignment.
Bodies on consignment.
Return them to the circus
And what is the purpose?
What is the purpose and would you believe it?
Would you believe it if you knew what you were for
And how you became so informed.

And there are various ways to conquer this, monotonous, metropolis
My stubbornness is bottomless
My fear is this is talking shit
And I am wide awake and I am taking names.Do you speak to me like you speak to God?
All the love and understanding between the father and the son?
Do you believe in the perfectness of where you are?
He's my people he's my children it's the land that I would fight for.
I saw an ebonese telling me to patiently move the music medicine around the planet in a hurry.
Cuz there's no time to waste.
Got to wake up the people time to stand up and say
We know what we are for
And how we became so informed.

It was almost impossible because it was, the dream was so big that I didn't see any chance, because I was living in a little town. I was studying and when I finally broke away from school and became a musician, I thought, "Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance," because all I really wanted to do is music, and not only play music, but compose music.

At that time, in Germany, in '69-'70, they had already discotheques. So I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes. I think I had about seven, eight songs. I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two years to survive in the beginning.

I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s, and then have a sound of the future, and then I thought, "Wait a second, I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer, which is the sound of the future?"

And I didn't have any idea what to do, but I knew I needed a click so we put the click on the 24-track which then was synced to the Moog modular. I knew that could be a sound of the future but I didn't realize how much the impact would be.

My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.

Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct, you can do whatever you want, so nobody told me what to do, and there was no preconception of what to do.</td>

I've gotta know we're better here than we were last year.

I can never just say what I mean,
Can only manage to say something similar.
If my tongue wasn't moored to the bow of my lips
Then I'd surely be able to say,
That our black and white has become grey.

Just the beating of hearts like two drums in the grey
I don't know what we're doing, I don't know what we've done
But the fire is coming, so I think we should run
I think we should run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

While I put on my shoes, he will button his coat
And we will step outside, checking that the coast is clear
On both sides, we don't want to be seen, no this is suicide
But you can't see the ropes
And I won't tell my mother, it's better she don't know
And he won't tell his folks, 'cause they're already ghosts

So we'll just keep each other as safe as we can
Until we reach the border, until we make our plan
To run, run, run, run
To run, run, run, run
To run, run, run, run

'Cause I don't want to be alone, when I'm in this state
Will you stay with me my love, 'til we're old and grey

But I don't want to imagine
Words you spoke to her that night
Naked bodies look like porcelain
You both know I'd be bleeding inside

Did she make your heart beat faster than I could?
Did she give you what you hoped for?
Oh nights so loveless, love
I hope it made you feel good

That's all we need because it's all we can take

One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
But no one gives us any time anymore

He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it then you ran off
I've got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

He sees right through me it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he will fall

One thousand lonely stars, hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't want to sing anymore

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore

Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while

Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before, I knew you

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch

And Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?

And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

A lifeless face that you'll soon forget

Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest

'Cause most of us are bitter over someone
Setting fire to our insides for fun
To distract our hearts from ever missing them
But I'm forever missing him

My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now where am I? My fading supply

"Did you get enough love, my little dove
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles"

The hospital asked should the body be cast
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

"Shall we look at the moon, my little loon
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light

Well you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?

You're keepin&#8217; me in the dark
My vision&#8217;s clear, I see ya left a mark
I'm a force and I won&#8217;t let you drag me down
Down...
If you go then I'm not goin' with you now
[Chorus]
Don't look back
Nothin&#8217; left to see
Just leave the shadows in the past
If I let it go
Can I shake this feelin'?
Oh oh oh
Just like that
Tomorrow's one day that I'm never getting back
I can feel you, though
Wake me from this dreamin'

[Outro]
Wake me from this dreamin'</td>

I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long

And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while

Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home</td>

It's the most virgin dress you could possibly wear
Mess it up, Time is up

Hold your memory for a moment with a blind hand
Write some stories for tomorrow
From the bottle of amnesia
Find instructions, to salvation, to oblivion, supreme

Don't be tempted to look back
It has all happen before

Someday miraculous spread will forgive every cowardly thing that you've done

That I've done

Dust it off

On to my knees, scrub them away

And how to be of use?
Make the tea and the soup
All of their favourites, throw them away
And all their school books and their running shoes
Washing them clean in the dirty steel sink

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Concentrates my mind
Helps me to sleep

Keep making beds, keep the cat fed
Open the windows, let the air in
Keep the house clean, keep the routine
Paintings they made still stuck to the fridge

Keep cleaning, keep ironing
Cooking their meals on the stainless steel hob
Keep washing, keep scrubbing
Long until the dark comes to bruise the sky
Deep in the debt to night

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Helps me to sleep

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Helps me to sleep

The most beautiful morning forever
Like the ones from far off, far off away
With the hum of the bees in the jasmine sway
Don't ever let go
Try to let go
Don't ever let go
Try to let go
Don't ever</td>

Cruel bindings.

Dog-men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over
Our sailors

I'm sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the tv
Tower, I want roses in
My garden bower; dig? 
Royal babies, rubies
Must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant that's plowed.

They are waiting to take us into
The severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest you've
Brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven's
Claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until it's other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law.

I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends
To the giant family.</td>

And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"

I love you
And I don't want to, ooh

Up all night
On another red eye
I wish we never learned to fly, I

Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry, I

Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"

I love you
And I don't want to, ooh

The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying

We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you

I don't want to
But I love you, ooh</td>

Because, you can be like that.
With all that humbleness, and all that respect.
All of the power invested in me
Be it hard to love my enemies.
All of the black bags over the heads of the dead and dying.
The more I understand about the human race
The less I comprehend about our purpose and place
And maybe if there was a clearer line the curiosity would satisfy.
Time based prophecies that kept me from living
In the moment I am struggling
To trust the divinity of all the guides
And what the hell they have planned for us.
I cry for the creatures who get left behind
But everything will change in a blink of an eye
And if you wish to survive
You will find the guide inside.
I go back and forth every single day
The clarity that comes to me in a choppy way
As the feelings
And the places
And the seasons change
The galaxies remain.
Energy fields cone the body in space.
The angels that are coming from a spiritual waste.
The hate that gets me distant from my spiritual pace.
Ten fold the manna when the planets are in place, in polar alignment.
We're on assignment.
Bodies on consignment.
Return them to the circus
And what is the purpose?
What is the purpose and would you believe it?
Would you believe it if you knew what you were for
And how you became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.
I am a miracle made up of particles
And in this existence
I'll stay persistent
And I'll make a difference
And I will have lived it.

Stick the peaches of my teacher when you follow where they lead.
All mysterious ways of nature and I am in to it.
Changing management.
And there are various ways to conquer this, monotonous, metropolis
My stubbornness is bottomless
My fear is this is talking shit
And I am wide awake and I am taking names.Do you speak to me like you speak to God?
All the love and understanding between the father and the son?
Do you believe in the perfectness of where you are?
He's my people he's my children it's the land that I would fight for.
I saw an ebonese telling me to patiently move the music medicine around the planet in a hurry.
Cuz there's no time to waste.
Got to wake up the people time to stand up and say
We know what we are for
And how we became so informed.
Bodies of info performing such miracles.

Dido - White Flag
lrc by the evil diva

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
I'll tell you that.
But if I didn't say it,
well I'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and
destruction to come back again
And I caused but nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
then I'm sure that that makes sense

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was then
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....
Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

To find a town where we can live
Even in the half light
We can see that something's gotta give

When we watched the markets crash
The promises we made were torn
Then my parents sent for me
From out West where I was born

Some people say they've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost
Pay the cost for what we've lost

Now that you have left me here
I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life

Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child
Pray to God I won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild

Though we knew this day would come
Still it took us by surprise
In this town where I was born
I now see through a dead man's eyes

One day they will see it's long gone
One day they will see it's long gone

One day they will see it's long gone
One day they will see it's long gone</td>

Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead

Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
And calls me on and on across the universe

Title: A Whiter Shade Of Pale

-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------

We skipped the light Fandango

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor

I was feeling kind of seasick

But the crowd called out for more

The room was humming harder

As the ceiling flew away

When we called out for another drink

The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later

As the Miller told his tale

That her face, at first just ghostly

Turned a whiter shade of pale

------ organ solo ------

She said there is no reason

And the truth is plain to see

But I wandered through my playing cards

And would not let her be

One of sixteen vestal virgins

Who were leaving for the coast

And although my eyes were open

They might just as well've been closed

And so it was that later

As the Miller told his tale

That her face, at first just ghostly

Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was.... (fade)

A kiss that can't renew

Tip toe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew

Sing for absolution

And falling from your grace

There's no where left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die

Falling from your grace

Sing for absolution

Cruel bindings.

Pulling poor blankets over
Our sailors

I'm sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the tv
Tower, I want roses in
My garden bower; dig? 
Royal babies, rubies
Must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant that's plowed.

They are waiting to take us into
The severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest you've
Brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven's
Claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until it's other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law.

I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends
To the giant family.</td>

We are two hearts joined together 
We will be forever as one 
My brother under the sun 

Wherever you hear - the wind in the canyon 
Wherever you see - the buffalo run 
Wherever you go - I'll be there beside you 
'Cause you are my brother - my brother under the sun

We are like birds of a feather 
We are two hearts joined together 
We will be forever as one 
My brother under the sun</td>

That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
Would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well have been closed

And so it was that later

Turned a whiter shade of pale

Title: Fix You
Album: X &amp; Y

---------------
---------------
---------------

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse?

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worst?

Lights will guide you home,
And ignite your bones,
And I will try to fix you,

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know
I told them, I said to them, Bernie, I said they'll never make their money back</td>

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing

Be my mirror, my sword and shield

Scarborough Fair
Simon and Garfunkel
Are you going to Scarborough fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needlework
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to find me an acre of land 
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strand
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

I know you tried
I know you tried your best
And now is time to put this all to rest
Minutes pass and those days seem long ago
Oh, oh
A distant voice
One that I used to know
There's a force?and?it&#8217;s?tryin' to drag?me down
Down...
If you?go then I'm goin&#8217; with you now

[Chorus]
Don't look back
Nothin' left to see
Just leave the shadows in the past
If I let it go
Can I shake this feelin'?
Oh oh oh
Just like that
Tomorrow's one day that I'm never getting back
I can feel you, though
Wake me from this dreamin'

[Verse 2]
Flip the switch
You're keepin&#8217; me in the dark
My vision&#8217;s clear, I see ya left a mark
I'm a force and I won&#8217;t let you drag me down
Down...
If you go then I'm not goin' with you now
[Chorus]
Don't look back
Nothin&#8217; left to see
Just leave the shadows in the past

Mirror, mirror
There's your crooked nose
Boring hair
A thousand wrinkles
No children
Just emptiness
No place like home
Just a f*cking mess
Mess
20 messages
Did you hurt your thumbs?
What a stupid game
Getting nothing done
With your longest track
Your highest score
While you crush your back
And lament the war
War
All the women
That you wanna f*ck
On the internet
Wouldn't give you a second look
Did you fool yourself?
That's privilege
That's power without power
That's a business
Business
But we know "you" is "I"
And I get overwhelmed
Can't sleep at night
Can't convince myself
To turn it off
To let go
Gotta make sense
Of the f*cking war
War
Am I runnin late?
I get overwhelmed
All the awful dreams
All the bright screens
Is my lover there?
Are we breakin up?
Did she find someone else?
And leave me alone?

That love could be so well hid
With regret, I'm willing to bet
And say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive
And harder to forget

It gets under your shirt
Like a dagger at work
The first cut is the deepest
But the rest still flipping hurt
You build your heart of plastic
Get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up?
When you're coked up
And can't remember the reason why you broke up?
You call her in the morning
When you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road

'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you wanna be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies, they flutter by and leave us on our arses

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
'Cause all I wanna do is try to make a connection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

Oh, I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
And I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

It seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Well it seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast 

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me, a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Stay away
Look out

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

WAKE UP!

You can't remember where it was
had this dream stopped?

Awake

Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see.

A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us.
Choose they croon the Ancient Ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances.</td>

The wall was too high
As you can see
No matter how he tried
He could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

Always doing what you're told

Breaking bottles in the hall

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

It makes me wonder
It makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

It makes me wonder
It really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadow's taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven</td>

Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why

And I don't know why
Why
And I don't know</td>

Title: Venus In Furs

Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather

Whiplash girlchild in the dark

Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him 

Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Downy sins of streetlight fancies

Chase the costumes she shall wear

Ermine furs adorn the imperious

Severin, Severin awaits you there

I am tired, I am weary

I could sleep for a thousand years

A thousand dreams that would awake me 

Different colors made of tears

Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather

Shiny leather in the dark

Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you 

Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Severin, Severin, speak so slightly

Severin, down on your bended knee

Taste the whip, in love not given lightly 

Taste the whip, now plead for me

I am tired, I am weary

I could sleep for a thousand years

A thousand dreams that would awake me 

Different colors made of tears

Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather 

Whiplash girlchild in the dark 

Severin, your servant comes in bells, please don't forsake him 

Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Angels on the sideline
Puzzled and amused
Why did Father give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused

[Chorus 1]
Don't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around?
Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys
Where there's one you're bound to divide it
Right in two

[Verse 2]
Angels on the sideline
Baffled and confused
Father blessed them all with reason
And this is what they choose?
(This is what they choose)

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they forge a blade
And where there's one they're bound to divide it
Right in two
Right in two

[Chorus 3]
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they make a club and beat their brother down
How they've survived so misguided is a mystery
Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability
To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here

Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two

Fight over the clouds, over wind, over sky and
Fight over life, over blood, over air and light
Over love, over sun, over another
Fight for the time, for the one, for the rise and

Angels on the sideline again
Benched along with patience and reason
Angels on the sideline again
Wondering where this tug of war will end

The dark one "Enterprise"
We talked and they told me this story
Now listen to this...

I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat
Soft driven, slow and mad
Like some new language

Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine messenger
Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god
Wandering, wandering in hopeless night

Awake

Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see.

A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us.
Choose they croon the Ancient Ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances.</td>

It's the
Edge of the world and all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it's settled in a finer location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin or is that war you're waging?

Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside, getting high on information
And buy me a star on the Boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road, but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are, to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no-one showed us to the land
And no-one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and something tries
Now starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can

And no-one calls us to move on
And no-one forces down our eyes
No-one speaks and no-one tries
No-one flies around the sun

Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no-one sings me lullabies
And no-one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky</td>

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever

Blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend,
You martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon,
You cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night,
And exposed to the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome
With random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper,
You prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and
I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child,
You winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion,
and shine!</td>

Meek and obedient, you follow the leader
Down well-trodden corridors, into the valley of steel
What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water.

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream 
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old</td>

To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it&#161;&#175;s like 
to be hated
To be faded 
to telling only lies
As my conscious seems to be
But my dreams they aren&#161;&#175;t as empty
I have hours, only lonely
As my conscious seems to be
My love is vengeance
I have hours, only lonely
That&#161;&#175;s never free
My love is vengeance

To feel these feelings
Like I do
and I blame you

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot o' whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without; I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
I just need you now

Oh, baby, I need you now</td>

Hotel California

On a dark desert highway,
cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas,
rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance,
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
&#8217;this could be heaven or this could be hell&#8217;
Then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to The Hotel California
Such a lovely place.. such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at The Hotel California
Any time of year.. any time of year,
you can find it here
Her mind is tiffany-twisted,
she got the mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,
that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard,
sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember,
some dance to forget
So I called up the captain,
&#8217;please bring me my wine&#8217;
He said, &#8217;we haven&#8217;t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine&#8217;
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say-ay...
Welcome to The Hotel California
Such a lovely place.. such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin&#8217; it up at The Hotel California
What a nice surprise!.. what a nice surprise!,
bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said &#8217;we are all just prisoners here, of our own device&#8217;
And in the master&#8217;s chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can&#8217;t kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
&#8217;relax,&#8217; said the night man,
We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like,
But you can never leave!

You and I we head back East
To find a town where we can live
Even in the half light
We can see that something's gotta give

When we watched the markets crash
The promises we made were torn
Then my parents sent for me
From out West where I was born

Some people say they've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost
Pay the cost for what we've lost

Now that you have left me here
I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life

Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child
Pray to God I won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild

Though we knew this day would come
Still it took us by surprise
In this town where I was born
I now see through a dead man's eyes

One day they will see it's long gone
One day they will see it's long gone

One day they will see it's long gone
One day they will see it's long gone</td>

None of us can tell they hide the ocean in a shell, 
the ocean in a shell

Our heads are just houses, without enough windows

They only echo, they only echo, only echo

Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

From your bed, I gained a day and lost a bloody year
And I would like to know
How do you feel (how do you feel)?
How do you feel (how do you feel)?

Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need?
I felt the cold far too soon in a room of ninety-five
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man?
Just you let me know
How do you feel (how do you feel)?
How do you feel (how do you feel)?

You know what they say...

Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing

And always look on the bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So, always look on the bright side of death
A-just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you

And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life

C'mon Brian, cheer up!

Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life

Worse things happen at sea, you know
Always look on the bright side of life

I mean, what have you got to lose
You know, you come from nothing, you're going back to nothing
What have you lost? Nothing!

Always look on the right side of life...

Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up you old bugger, c'mon give us a grin!
There you are, see, it's the end of the film
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer
Some of us have to got live as well, you know
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish
They're not gonna make their money back, you know

 And quikly he's subdued 
 Through constant pain disgrace
 The young boy learns their rules

 With time the child draws in
 This whipping boy done wrong
 Deprived of all his thoughts

 A vow unto his own 
 That never from this day
 His will they'll take away

 To running all of his

 Throughout his life the same

 To die regretfully

When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'mma live my life like I should (Like I should)

Now all the critics wanna hit it
Ya shit can how we did it just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from his critics

Do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast, it's moving really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass

Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid, so, what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when your starin' down the cable of a
A mic pointed at your grill like a gun?

Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette when you're placin' your bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and your done
'Cause I'mma be the one till I jet (I'mma be the one till I jet)

I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me

'Cause hate is all the world has ever seen lately

Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Does anybody really know the secret
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)

I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, a microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' on my mind every second with my fist

Everybody wanna run, wanna run
Everybody wanna hide from the gun, from the gun
You can take a ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take that edge off that knife, no, sir

And now you want your money back, money back
But you're denied 'cause your brains fried from the sack
And there ain't nothing I can do
'Cause life is a lesson; you learn it when you're through

I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me

Title: Smoke On The Water

 

 

 

We all came out to montreux

On the lake geneva shoreline

To make records with a mobile

We didn&#8217;t have much time

Frank zappa and the mothers

Were at the best place around

But some stupid with a flare gun

Burned the place to the ground

 

Smoke on the water

fire in the sky

 

Smoke on the water

 

  

They burned down the gambling house

It died with an awful sound

Funky claude was running in and out

Pulling kids out the ground

When it all was over

We had to find another place

But swiss time was running out

It seemed that we would lose the race

 

Smoke on the water

fire in the sky

 

Smoke on the water

 

 

We ended up at the grand hotel

It was empty cold and bare

But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside

Making our music there

With a few red lights and a few old beds

We make a place to sweat

No matter what we get out of this

I know

I know we&#8217;ll never forget

Smoke on the water

fire in the sky

 

Smoke on the water

Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to The Gallow's Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Motherfuckers!
Running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream?

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not so easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there is never an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell God be with you
If there's a God then why has he let me die?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away

Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
Please don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth

So when you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion

Oh, hallowed be thy name
Oh, hallowed be thy
Name

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name

Isn't it weird? Looks too obscure to me
Wasting away, that was the policy

I'm ready to leave, I push the fact in front of me
Facts lost, facts are never what they seem to be
There's nothing there, no information left of any kind
Lifting my head, lo-lo-looking for danger signs

The island of doubt, it's like a taste of medicine
Working by hindsight, got the message from the oxygen
M-m-making a list, find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right, facts are useful in emergencies

[Chorus 3]
The feeling returns, whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head, looking around inside

[Verse 4]
Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are lame
Facts don't come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of men

I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb</td>

This shell of bloody treason

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore

Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

The blind men shout "Let the creatures out!
We'll show the unbelievers
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime-time Belsen feast... yeah!"

As the reasons for the carnage
Cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine
And feed it with our babies

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore

Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

The body bags and little rags
Of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain
To put the finger right on you

As the madmen play on words
And make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions
To make a better kind of gun

The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore

Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight

How it go, it's not a joke, there's gon' be a homicide
I'm a ride, I'm a rep me a nigga up in the box
And send 'em to his folks, his bloods, his kin
The drama it don't end, bust a gun
Bust a nigga's face open with the hand
Tell 'em go tell a friend, tell a cop, tell the FEDS
I don't give a mothafuck, you niggas in the Ps
I'm a let the world see you, you're a bitch, you're a snitch
I'm a Mobb Deep gangsta, Infamous soldier
If you got a cold heart then my shit just froze over

The windows on the crib, bullet proof them

Quens mothafucka, move and get smoked up

A nigga get at me I'm gon' get 'em right back

You could put 'em in redtops and bump that back
On the block or the corner, you slip you a goner
Your nose's getting warmer, the Ds out for ya

Always on my fly shit never catch the kid bummy
Shorty on my nuts like sweats
And it taste like metals and I swear I'm to protected

Play the song with the funky break"
And go-kart Mozart
Was checking out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early Pearly
Came by in his curly wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride

Asked me if I needed a ride
'Cause she was blinded by the light

She's gonna make it to the night

But mama, that's where the fun is

Some brimstone baritone
Anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone
Hit it in its funny bone
That's where they expect it least"
And some new mown chaperone
Was standing in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone
Was messing with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance

The calliope crashed to the ground

We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together now

Lock up the streets and houses
Because there's something in the air
We got to get together sooner or later
Because the revolution's here

And you know it's right
And you know that it's right
We have got to get it together
We have got to get it together now

Hand out the arms and ammo
We're gonna blast our way through here
We got to get together sooner or later
Because the revolution's here

And you know it's right
And you know that it's right
We have got to get it together

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
And if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

Woah oh oh, sweet child o' mine
Woah oh oh oh, sweet love of mine

Telling me no lies
And knocking me out

Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come
But I was already there

'Cause the walls started shaking
The earth was quaking

Shook me all night long

Shook me all night long

Working double time 
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind
She's just mine all mine

Wanted no applause
Just another course
Made a meal out of me
And come back for more

Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring
To take another swing

That the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it

Shook me all night long

I think about my grave
When I'm gonna have one

It feels good to rest
It's been a long long day
It's been a long, it's been a long, it's been a long long day

Oh I am on a ride
Measure the distance in time
And as sure as I was born
I will die

And on my way back home
Stopped at your tombstone
Said a prayer for you
I was tired and alone
Said lord I miss my friend
Who's underneath my feet
May her soul, oh may her soul, oh may her soul rest in peace</td>

Then I knowed love was here to stay

When she told me to
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Walk this way, walk this way
Just gimme a kiss!

Like this
Ooh
Uh

School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school

When she told me how to walk this way

She told me to

There's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me

You woo me until the sun comes up

To be where I have been

To sit with elders of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Who talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
Though not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear

Whoa-oh-hoh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Ooh, oh, baby, I've been flying, no, yeah
Mama cares, ain't no denying
Oh, ooh yes, I've been flying
My mama, ain't no denying, no denying, no

As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find
Where I've been, ah-ah, ah-ah

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Who hid the path that led me to that place
With yellow desert screen

My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that blows high in June
When moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

His mother sent newspaper clippings to him
About his old friends who'd stopped being boys
There was Harwitz E. Green, just turned thirty-three
His leather chair waits at the bank
And Seargent Dow Jones, twenty-seven years old
Commanding his very own tank
But Lather still finds it a nice thing to do
To lie about nude in the sand
Drawing pictures of mountains that look like bumps
And thrashing the air with his hands

But wait, oh Lather's productive you know
He produces the finest of sound
Putting drumsticks on either side of his nose
Snorting the best licks in town
But that's all over...

Lather was thirty years old today
And Lather came foam from his tongue
He looked at me eyes wide and plainly said
Is it true that I'm no longer young?
And the children call him famous
What the old men call insane
And sometimes he's so nameless
That he hardly knows which game to play...
Which words to say...
And I should have told him, "No, you're not old."
And I should have let him go on...smiling...babywide</td>

Nobody's gonna slow me down

Nobody's gonna mess me round

(Young, Young, Johnson)
Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long I'm glad to be back [I bet you know I'm...]
Yes, I'm let loose
From the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I've been looking at the sky
'Cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
I got nine lives
Cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and running wild
CHORUS:
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
(Well) I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Back in the back
Of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang
With a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
Cause I'm back on the track
And I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now
I'm just makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
CHORUS
Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well I'm back in black
Yes I'm back in black

Well I'm back, I'm back
Back in black
Yes I'm back in black

hooo yeah
Ohh yeah
Yes I am
Oooh yeah, yeah Oh yeah
Back
Back in black
Yes I'm back in black

Back in now
Back, I'm back
Back, I'm back
Back, I'm back
Back, I'm back
Out of the sight

As the tears rolled down your cheeks

And I'll never look behind

Giving substance to shadows
Giving substance evermore

And you assume you got something to offer
Secrets shiny and new

Yeah... Ha Ha!
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cos I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hearable
What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy
Lifeless
To know the definition for what life is
Priceless
For you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?
Gunsmokin' righteous with one token
Psychic among those
Possess you with one go

The essence the basics
Without it you make it
Allow me to make this
Child, like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child and beast
Every cloud you see
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion heprovides
with me as a guide
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing, remember
(that it's all in your head)

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag

There was sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed

And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

Lalala...

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings

The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain

I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

She said, "Some days I feel like shit"
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long

And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Come back home, you know the place where you used to live
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once and a while

Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing, "Where'd you go?"

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin'
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home</td>

Dido - White Flag
lrc by the evil diva

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
I'll tell you that.
But if I didn't say it,
well I'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and
destruction to come back again
And I caused but nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
then I'm sure that that makes sense

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was then
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....
Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Well I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Title: Fix You
Album: X &amp; Y

---------------
---------------
---------------

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse?

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worst?

Lights will guide you home,
And ignite your bones,
And I will try to fix you,

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

That's why we're still driving around and around

Wasted hours before we knew
Where to go and what to do
Wasted hours that you made new
And turned into a life that we can live

Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
And what was that line you said
(Something about how our time it owns us now)

Wishing you were anywhere but here
You watch the life you're living disappear
And now I see, we're still kids in buses longing to be free

Wasted hours before we knew
Where to go and what to do
Wasted hours that you made new
And turned into a life that we can live

A life that we can live

A life that we can live

She was 3 years older than me, but in no time we became friends
We'd listen to her mix tapes; Dead Can Dance, Felt, This Mortal Coil...
She introduced me to her favourite books, gave me clothes, and my first cigarette
Sometimes we would head down to Blackbirds moor to watch the barges on Grand Union in the twilight
She said "The water has no memory"
For a few months everything about our lives was perfect
It was only us, we were inseparable
But gradually she passed into another distant part of my memory
Until I could no longer remember her face, her voice, even her name

We have got, we have got the perfect life</td>

Blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend,
You martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon,
You cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night,
And exposed to the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome
With random precision,
Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
Come on you painter, you piper,
You prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers and
I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow
Of yesterday's triumph,
And sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child,
You winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion,
and shine!</td>

I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying, "I love you"

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Oh, yeah</td>

Can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you, don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high
As you can see
No matter how he tried
He could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

It makes me wonder
It makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

It makes me wonder
It really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind, oh

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadow's taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven</td>

Found my way downstairs and drank a cup

Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke

Catching the swirling wind, the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create, as weather spins out of hand

Go closer, hold the land, feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears, we stand surrounded by million years

A live wire, barely a beginner

She's on fire 'cause dancing gets her higher
Than anything else she knows

Don't worry too much, it'll happen to you
We were children once playing with toys
And the thing that you're hearing is only the sound
Of the low spark of high heeled boys

While you're living beyond all your means
And the man in the suit has just bought a new car
From the profit he's made on your dreams
But today you just read that the man was shot dead
By a gun that didn't make any noise
But it wasn't the bullet that laid him to rest
Was the low spark of high heeled boys

If you had just a minute to breathe
And they granted you one final wish
Would you ask for something like another chance
Or something similar as this
Don't worry too much, it'll happen to you
As sure as your sorrows are joys
And the thing that disturbs you is only the sound
Of the low spark of high heeled boys

If I gave you everything that I owned
And asked for nothing in return
Would you do the same for me as I would for you?
Or take me for a ride
And strip me of everything including my pride
But spirit is something that no one destroys
And the sound that I'm hearing is only the sound of
The low spark of high heeled boys

Hope you find your paradise

Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain

It's not for me (Goodbye, Jane)
Just give me motion (Will we ever)
To set me free (Meet again?)
In the land and the ocean (Feel no sorrow)
Far away (Feel no shame)
It's the life I've chosen (Come tomorrow)
Every day (Feel no pain)
So goodbye, Mary (Goodbye, Mary)
Goodbye, Jane (Goodbye, Jane)

And some you just can't tell
And some they will and some they won't
With some it's just as well

You can laugh at my behaviour
And that'll never bother me
Say the devil is my saviour
But I don't pay no heed

And I will go on shining

Goodbye, stranger, it's been nice
Hope you find your paradise

On board, I'm the captain
So climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow
On every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try
To carry on

I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had

We lived happily forever
So the story goes
But somehow we missed out
On the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can
To carry on

A gathering of angels
Appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope
And this is what they said, they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, baby
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

I thought that they were angels
But to my surprise
We climbed aboard their starship
We headed for the skies, singing
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

Born to be wild

Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
And whatever comes our way

Yeah, darling go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once and
Explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never want to die

Born to be wild
Born to be wild</td>

I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax

Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Breathe Reprise

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire

Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell</td>

"I hope you're having fun."

Well, the night was falling as the desert world
Began to settle down
In the town they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found

Band on the run
Band on the run
And the county judge who held a grudge
Will search forever more
For the band on the run
For the band on the run

All the stars above who died came from
Somewhere beyond the scene you see
These lovely people played just for me

Now if I let you see this place
Where stories all ring true
Will you let me past your face
To see what's really you
It's not for me I ask this question
As though I were a king
For you have to love, believe, and feel
Before the burst of tambourines take you there

Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone, souls and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you

Those who don't believe me
Find your souls and set them free
Those who do, believe and know
This time will be your key
Time and time again I've thanked them
For a peace of mind
That helped me find myself
Amongst the music and the rhyme
That enchants you there

Green grass and high tides forever
Castles of stone, souls and glory
Lost faces say we adore you
As kings and queens bow and play for you

'Cause when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is burning in its greed

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
Because the truth is hard to swallow
That's what the war of love is for

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way that you mean it
When you tell me what will be

And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see 
What it's done to me
To lose the the love I knew
Could safely lead me through

Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me

But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see 
What it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old
The secrets of our souls

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way you really mean it
When you tell me what will be

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war?

'Cause when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need

Play the song with the funky break"
And go-kart Mozart
Was checking out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early Pearly
Came by in his curly wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride

Asked me if I needed a ride
'Cause she was blinded by the light

She got down but she never got tight
She's gonna make it to the night

Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is

Some brimstone baritone
Anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone
Hit it in its funny bone
That's where they expect it least"
And some new mown chaperone
Was standing in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone
Was messing with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance

I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha trying to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"
I said, "Excuse me"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord
A-pointing that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me, but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Oh, won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, a-mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, a-mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure

Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Oh, won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, a-mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, a-mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
Show me the back door</td>

And many times I've gazed
Along the open road

Many times I've lied
And many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered
How much there is to know

Many dreams come true
And some have silver linings
I live for my dream
And a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man
Who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men
Can't see the open road

Many is a word

Guessing 'bout a thing

Time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged
Such a pleasant stay

But now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon lights my way
For now, I smell the rain and with it pain
And it's headin' my way

Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I got to find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, I find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I got to find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

I ain't tellin' you no lies

Mine's a tale that can't be told
My freedom, I hold dear
How years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air

T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, the evil one
Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, her, her, yeah

And ain't nothing I can do, no

I guess I'll keep on rambling, I'm gonna shake
Sing my song, I've gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world, baby, baby
Ramble on, yeah

I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my babe, I really got to part
I gotta keep searching for my baby
I gotta keep-a searching for my baby

Oooh, I can't find my bluebird
I listen to my bluebird sing but
I can't find my bluebird
I keep a-rambling baby
I keep a-rambling baby</td>

Somewhere, a king has no wife

The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead

And with this crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers, "No, this will be the last"

Trippin' back now to places you've been to
You wonder what you're gonna find
You know you've been wrong but it won't be long
Before you leave 'em all far behind

'Cause it's the new Mother Nature takin' over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new Mother Nature takin' over
She's gettin' us all
She's gettin' us all

Jocko said "No" when I came back last time
It's lookin' like I lost a friend
No use callin' 'cause the sky is fallin'
And I'm gettin' pretty near the end
A smoke-filled room in a corner basement
The situation must be right
A bag of goodies and a bottle of wine
We're gonna get it on right tonight

'Cause it's the new Mother Nature takin' over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new Mother Nature takin' over
She's gettin' us all
She's gettin' us all

(Lonely feeling) Jocko says "Yes" and I believe him
(Deep inside) When we talk about the things I say
(Find a corner) She hasn't got the faith or the guts to leave him
(Where I can hide) When they're standin' in each other's way

(Silent footsteps) Trippin' back now to places you've been to
(Crowding me) You wonder what you're gonna find
(Sudden darkness) You know you've been wrong and it won't be long
(But I can see) Before you leave 'em all far behind

'Cause it's the new Mother Nature takin' over
It's the new splendid lady come to call
It's the new Mother Nature takin' over
She's gettin' us all
She's gettin' us all

Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seein' double
Pays my ticket when I speed

She come skimming through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia
Ringin' that blue bell
Golder than sunlight
Go on out singing
I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey, come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight
Crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander 'round
I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream
Walkin' in the tall trees
Goin' where the wind blows
Bloomin' like a red rose
Breathin' more freely
Light out singing, I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream
Walk you in the sunshine</td>

Hotel California

On a dark desert highway,
cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas,
rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance,
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
&#8217;this could be heaven or this could be hell&#8217;
Then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to The Hotel California
Such a lovely place.. such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at The Hotel California
Any time of year.. any time of year,
you can find it here
Her mind is tiffany-twisted,
she got the mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,
that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard,
sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember,
some dance to forget
So I called up the captain,
&#8217;please bring me my wine&#8217;
He said, &#8217;we haven&#8217;t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine&#8217;
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say-ay...
Welcome to The Hotel California
Such a lovely place.. such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin&#8217; it up at The Hotel California
What a nice surprise!.. what a nice surprise!,
bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said &#8217;we are all just prisoners here, of our own device&#8217;
And in the master&#8217;s chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can&#8217;t kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
&#8217;relax,&#8217; said the night man,
We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like,
But you can never leave!

How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man, and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes</td>

In the heart of the cold, cold city

He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster, the lights are turning red"

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane

Are you with me so far

Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they were heavily billed

There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice she was caught up in the race
Out every evening until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane

Blowing and burning, blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worse
She said, "Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring
We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing"

He said, "Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash"
"The doctor say he's coming, but you gotta pay in cash"
They went rushing down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dying to get off
And it was

Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time

Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh

Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh, yeah
Ooh

Ziggy played guitar</td>

Said, "I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm
Gonna join in a rock and roll band
Got to get back to the land
And set my soul free"

We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

Well, then can I walk beside you?
I have come to lose the smog
And I feel myself a cog 
In somethin' turning

And maybe it's the time of year
Yes, and maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning

We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song
And a celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust, we are golden
We are caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves

There's always somebody tempting somebody into

And they tempt you with the pleasure
That the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple

And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
Yeah, it's bigger than a Subaru
Hey, man, there's only one thing 
And one car that will do
Anyway, we don't have to drive it
Honey, we can park it out in back
And have a party in your Pink Cadillac

Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls

I saw you last night
Out on the edge of town
I want to read your mind to know
Just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow

Well, I've tried so hard baby
But I just can't see
Oh, what a woman like you
Is doing with me

So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
Oh, when out go the lights

I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now, you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand

Oh, we stood at the altar
The gypsy swore our future was bright
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of</td>

Alright!

Well, there's a girl that lives up the block
Back at school she could turn all the boys' heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed

Her and her husband Bobby, well, they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talkin' 'bout the old times
She says when she feels like crying she starts laughing thinking about

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by

I think I'm going down to the well tonight

It's a death trap
It's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us

Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run 'til we drop, and baby, we'll never go back

Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know if love is wild
Babe, I wanna know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

Beyond the palace
Hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard

The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in the mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss, huh

One, two, three, four
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all of the madness in my soul

Oh, someday, girl, I don't know when

And we'll walk in the sun

You can listen to the engine
Moaning out its one-note song
You can think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're riding sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go -- turn the page

Well, you walk into a restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Most times you can't hear 'em talk
Other times you can
All the same old clich&#233;s:
"Is that a woman or a man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
So you don't dare make a stand

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go -- turn the page

Out there in the spotlight
You're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy
You try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body
Like the music that you play

Later in the evening
As you lie awake in bed
With the echoes from the amplifiers
Ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Remembering what she said

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go -- turn the page

What he don't know to begin with?

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck"
But you don't mean it

When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it?

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them

And know I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem?

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you</td>

Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging
For your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh, you've gone to the finest school, alright, miss lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get
Used to it

You say you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say: "Do you want to
Make a deal?"

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To hang on your home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking thinking that they
Got it made
Exchanging all their precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, baby

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets
To conceal

How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own

We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in

Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

Ooh

School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this

To cut him skin from bone
And the miller he has served him worse than that
For he's ground him between two stones

And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl
And he's brandy in the glass
And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl
Proved the strongest man at last

Nor so loudly to blow his horn
And the tinker he can't mend kettle nor pot

A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the governor, boo boo boo
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth

Sweet home Alabama

Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Ah ah ah

Alabama

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
(Yes, they do!)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, now how about you?

Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Sweet home Alabama, oh, sweet home baby
Where the skies are so blue and the governor's true
Sweet home Alabama, Lordy

Stealing through the dark of night
Climbing through a window, stepping to the floor
Checking to the left and the right
Picking up the pieces, putting them away
Something doesn't feel quite right

Help me someone, let me out of here
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
"Welcome to the Home by the Sea"

Coming out the woodwork, through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows with no substance, in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sigh and they moan

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
"Welcome to the Home by the Sea"

Sit down... Sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer, longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance, photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
"Welcome to the Home by the Sea"

Sit down... Sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you

Sit down... Sit down
Cause you won't get away
No with us you will stay
For the rest of your days. So sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you</td>

I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above?
If the Bible tells you so
Now, do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage bronkin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book on Marx
A quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry 
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' "This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die"

They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye

Beg to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA'

He spoke of lands not far
Nor lands they were in his mind
Of fusion captured high
Where reason captured his time
In no time at all he took me to the gate
In haste I quickly
Checked the time
If I was late
I had to leave, to hear your wonderous stories
Had to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA, LA AHA'

Hearing
Hearing hearing your wonderous stories
Hearing your wonderous stories
It is no lie I see deeply into the future
Imagine everything
You're close
And were you there
To stand so cautiously at first
And then so high
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky
I bid it to return
To hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories

I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said, "You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away"
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwin' punches around
And preachin' from my chair

Well, who are you?
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
I really wanna know
Who are you?
Who who, who who?
Tell me who are you

I took the tube back outta town
Back to the rollin' pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccuped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the tin pan
God there's got to be another way

I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

Well who are you?

Sexually knowing

Eau-de-cologning

Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging
Prettier women.

Magically bored
On a quiet street corner
Free frustration
In our minds and our toes
Quiet storm water

Uppers and downers
Either way blood flows

Leave me alone

Nowhere is home
Inside outside
Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the five fifteen
Out of my brain on a train

On a raft in the quarry
Slowly sinking
On the back of a lorry
Holy hitching
Dreadfully sorry
Apple scrumping
Born in the war
Birthday punching

He man drag
In the glittering ballroom
Greyly outrageous
In my high heel shoes
Tightly undone
They know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic
That their heroes are news

But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind with the kids, they're alright
The kids are alright

Sometimes, I feel I gotta get away
Bells chime, I know I gotta get away
And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind with the kids, they're alright
The kids are alright</td>

No more time spent sweatin' rent

Hear my command
I'm breakin' loose, it ain't no use
Holdin' me down
Stick around

But baby (Baby)
Remember (Remember)

It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

There'll be women and their fortunes
Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry when I'm squeezin' the rye?
Takin' all I can get, no regrets

When I openly lie
And leave only money
Believe me, honey, that money
Can you believe I ain't no saint
No complaints

So, girl, go out
Hand it out

And baby (Baby)
Remember (Remember)

It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

(It's my life and I'll do what I want) Don't push me
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want) It's my life
(It's my life and I'll do what I want) And I can do what I want
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want) You can't tell me

She sends a cable coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all

We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a wave in the air
Radar love

The radio is playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm speeding into a new sunrise

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need no letter at all

We've got a line in the sky
Radar love

No more speed, I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars goes down real slow

And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh, one more radar lover gone

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don't need no letter at all

Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, "I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk"
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one</td>

This far from the borderline

He knows damn well he has been cheated

Told them you were living downtown
Driving all the old men crazy

Down at Dino's Bar and Grill

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality

You're windy and wild, you've got the blues in your shoes and your
stockings
You're windy and wild, oh yeah
You're built like a car, you've got a hub cap diamond star halo
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl.

refrain

You're dirty and sweet, clad in black, don't look back
And I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
You dance when you walk so let's dance, take a chance, understand me
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl.

Then in flies a guy who's all dressed up just like a Union Jack
And says I've won five pounds if I have his kind of detergent pack

I said hey (hey), you (you), get off of my cloud
Hey (hey), you (you), get off of my cloud
Hey (hey), you (you), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby

The telephone is ringing I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?" "Well, I guess I'm doin' fine"
He says, "It's 3 AM, there's too much noise, don't you people ever wanna go to bed?
Just 'cause you feel so good, do you have to drive me out of my head?"

I said hey (hey), you (you), get off of my cloud
Hey (hey), you (you), get off of my cloud
Hey (hey), you (you), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby, yeah

I was sick and tired, fed up with this and decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful, there was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out, I was so tired and I started to dream
In the mornin' the parkin' tickets were just like rags stuck on my windscreen

I said hey (hey), you (you), get off of my cloud
Hey (hey), you (you), get off of my cloud
Hey (hey), you (you), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud

Cause you didn't want to be alone

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band

"Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day"
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile

Well, I sold a million mirrors in a shop in an alleyway
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you "Be a superstar"
But I tell you just be satisfied, stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, yeah
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
Honey, you'll survive

Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal

(guitar solo)

i've paid my dues

time after time

i've done my sentence

but committed no crime

and bad mistakes

i've made a few

i've had my share of sand

kicked in my face

but i've come through

and i need to go on and on and on and on
we are the champions - my friend
and we'll keep on fighting till the end
we are the champions
we are the champions
no time for losers
'cause we are the champions of the world
i've taken my bows
and my curtain calls
you've bought me fame and fortune
and everything that goes with it
i thank you all
but it's been no bed of roses no pleasant cruises
i consider it a challenge before the whole human race
and i ain't gonna lose
and i need to go on and on and on and on

we are the champions - my friend
and we'll keep on fighting till the end
we are the champions
we are the champions
no time for losers
'cause we are the champions of the world
we are the champions - my friend

and we'll keep on fighting till the end

we are the champions
we are the champions

no time for losers

'cause we are the champions..

As the ceiling flew away

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
Would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well have been closed

When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

I hate to think I've been blinded, baby
Why can't I see you tonight

And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up, make it all right, yeah
It's all right, all right

And if you promised your love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you would never leave me, baby

As you wish all your dreams would come true, hey
It ain't the first time, believe me, baby
I'm standing here feeling blue, blue
Ha, yeah I'm blue

Ho, babe

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes, no longer
And then I'm turning around, 'round

And the clock on the wall's moving slower
Oh, my heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found, found

Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

Hey, babe

Ooh, hands on the clock
They just don't seem to stop
When I'm thinking it over
Whoo, time and a light
That I just don't seem to find
Gotta get away, get away
Whoa ooh, I see it in my dreams
But I just don't seem to be
I gotta get on, gotta get on, gotta get on
I've gotta get on, ooh

Ooh, now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet, oh
I've got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess

And I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless
When I'm breathless, I'll run till I drop, hey
The thoughts of a fool's kinda careless
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block

Oh yeah, hey now
Ah, ah, ho, ho

Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said
"Hey, boy, do you wanna score?"
And you know how it is
I really don't know what time it was, whoa-oh-oh
So I asked them if I could stay awhile.

I didn't notice, but it had got very dark and I was really,
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me asked us said
"Please, hey, would we care
To all get in line, get in line."
Well, you know
They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, whoa-oh-oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sittin' spare like a book on a shelf rustin'
Ah, not tryin' to fight it
You really don't care if they're comin', whoa-oh-oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better
You better open your eyes, whoa-oh yeah
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now
So I'm packin' my bags for the misty mountains,
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills, where the spirits fly.

Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
Mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun begin to awake
Watch out

Got a punch on the nose and it's starting to flow
I think I might be sinkin'
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
Meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings, la la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standin' on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, mmm ah</td>

In every house and on every street
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete

Don't step on Greta Garbo
As you walk down the boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile
That's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

Rudolph Valentino
Looks very much alive
And he looks up ladies' dresses
As they sadly pass him by
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life

If you covered him with garbage
George Sanders would still have style
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn 'round and smile
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
'Cause she's not very tough
She should have been made of iron or steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood

You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in show-biz
It doesn't matter who you are
And those who are successful
Be always on your guard
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard

I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
'Cause celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die

You can see all the stars as you walk along Hollywood Boulevard

My words but a whisper, your deafness a shout.
I may make you feel but I can't make you think.
Your sperm's in the gutter, your love's in the sink.

So you ride yourselves over the fields and
You make all your animal deals and
Your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick.

And the sand-castle virtues are all swept away
In the tidal destruction the moral melee.
The elastic retreat rings the close of play
As the last wave uncovers the newfangled way.

But your new shoes are worn at the heels
And your suntan does rapidly peel
And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick.

And the love that I feel is so far away:
I'm a bad dream that I just had today
And you shake your head
And say it's a shame.

Spin me back down the years and the days of my youth.
Draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth.
Spin me down the long ages, let them sing the song.

See there! A son is born --
And we pronounce him fit to fight.
There are black-heads on his shoulders,
And he pees himself in the night.
We'll make a man of him
Put him to trade
Teach him to play Monopoly
And not to sing in the rain.

The Poet and the painter casting shadows on the water --
As the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea.
The do-er and the thinker: no allowance for the other --
As the failing light illuminates the mercenary's creed.
The home fire burning: the kettle almost boiling --
But the master of the house is far away.
The horses stamping -- their warm breath clouding
In the sharp and frosty morning of the day.
And the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword.

And the youngest of the family
Is moving with authority.
Building castles by the sea,
He dares the tardy tide
To wash them all aside.

The cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river
Where the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea:
The builder of the castles renews the age-old purpose
And contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need.
The young men of the household have all gone into service
And are not to be expected for a year.
The innocent young master -- thoughts moving ever faster --
Has formed the plan to change the man he seems.
And the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword.

And the oldest of the family
Is moving with authority.
Coming from across the sea,
He challenges the son
Who puts him to the run.

What do you do when the old man's gone --
Do you want to be him?
And your real self sings the song.
Do you want to free him?
No one to help you get up steam --
And the whirlpool turns you 'way off-beam.

Later.
I've come down from the upper class
To mend your rotten ways.
My father was a man-of-power
Whom everyone obeyed.
So come on all you criminals!
I've got to put you straight
Just like I did with my old man --
Twenty years too late.
Your bread and water's going cold.
Your hair is too short and neat.
I'll judge you all and make damn sure
That no one judges me.

You curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone --
You meet the stares. You're unaware that your doings aren't done.
And you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be.
But how are we supposed to see where we should run?

I see you shuffle in the courtroom with your rings upon your fingers
And your downy little sidies and your silver-buckle shoes.
Playing at the hard case, you follow the example
Of the comic-paper idol who lets you bend the rules.

So! Come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't you rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books your super crooks
And show us all the way.
Well! Make your will and testament.
Won't you? Join your local government.
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day.

You put your bet on number one and it comes up every time.
The other kids have all backed down and they put you first in line.
And so you finally ask yourself just how big you are --
And take your place in a wiser world of bigger motor cars.
And you wonder who to call on.

So! Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though?
They're all resting down in Cornwall --
Writing up their memoirs for a paper-back edition of the Boy Scout Manual.

Later.
See there! A man born --
And we pronounce him fit for peace.
There's a load lifted from his shoulders
With the discovery of his disease.
We'll take the child from him
Put it to the test
Teach it to be a wise man
How to fool the rest.

Quote
We will be geared to the average rather than the exceptional
God is an overwhelming responsibility
We walked through the maternity ward and saw 218 babies wearing nylons
It says here that cats are on the upgrade
Upgrade? Hipgrave. Oh, Mac.

Later
In the clear white circles of morning wonder,
I take my place with the lord of the hills.
And the blue-eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured (in neat little rows)
Sporting canvas frills.
With their jock-straps pinching, they slouch to attention,
While queueing for sarnies at the office canteen.
Saying -- how's your granny and good old Ernie:
He coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win.

The legends (worded in the ancient tribal hymn) lie cradled in the seagull's call.
And all the promises they made are ground beneath the sadist's fall.
The poet and the wise man stand behind the gun,
And signal for the crack of dawn. Light the sun.

Do you believe in the day?
Do you? Believe in the day!
The Dawn Creation of the Kings has begun.
Soft Venus (lonely maiden) brings the ageless one.

Do you believe in the day?
Do you? Believe in the day!
The fading hero has returned to the night --
And fully pregnant with the day, wise men endorse the poet's sight.
Do you believe in the day?
Do you? Believe in the day!

Let me tell you the tales of your life
Of your love and the cut of the knife
The tireless oppression the wisdom instilled
The desire to kill or be killed.
Let me sing of the losers who lie
In the street as the last bus goes by.
The pavements are empty: the gutters run red --
While the fool toasts his god in the sky.

So come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus.
Mark the precise nature of your fear.

Let me help you pick up your dead
As the sins of the father are fed
With the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise
And from the pan under your bed.
Let me make you a present of song as
The wise man breaks wind and is gone while
The fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and
The nursery rhyme winds along.

So! Come all ye young men who are building castles!
Kindly state the time of the year
And join your voices in a hellish chorus.
Mark the precise nature of your fear.
See! The summer lightning casts its bolts upon you
And the hour of judgement draweth near.
Would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour
Or the wiser man who rushes clear.

So! Come on ye childhood heroes!
Won't your rise up from the pages
Of your comic-books your super-crooks
And show us all the way.
Well! Make your will and testament.
Won't you? Join your local government.
We'll have Superman for president
Let Robin save the day.

So! Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?
And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you through?
They're all resting down in Cornwall -- writing up their memoirs
For a paper-back edition of the Boy Scout Manual.

Of course
So you ride yourselves over the fields
And you make all your animal deals
And your wise men don't know how it feels
To be thick as a brick.</td>

Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sitting and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Outta the door and down to the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me you got to play your hand
Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Living on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is, ain't it a shame

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

And you're sick of hangin' around and you like to travel
Get tired of travelin' you wanna settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get outta the door and light out and look all around

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a-goin' home
Whoa-whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on</td>

Thick smoke, see her smiling through

Well, I got a few of my own

Ooh, someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams
We're gonna find one
One that really screams

I've been searching for the daughter
Of the devil himself
I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman
Who's a little of both
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight

Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

One of these nights
In between the dark and the light
Coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you

Title: Smoke On The Water

 

 

 

We all came out to montreux

On the lake geneva shoreline

To make records with a mobile

We didn&#8217;t have much time

Frank zappa and the mothers

Were at the best place around

But some stupid with a flare gun

Burned the place to the ground

 

Smoke on the water

fire in the sky

 

Smoke on the water

 

  

They burned down the gambling house

It died with an awful sound

Funky claude was running in and out

Pulling kids out the ground

When it all was over

We had to find another place

But swiss time was running out

It seemed that we would lose the race

 

Smoke on the water

fire in the sky

 

Smoke on the water

 

 

We ended up at the grand hotel

It was empty cold and bare

But with the rolling truck stones thing just outside

Making our music there

With a few red lights and a few old beds

We make a place to sweat

No matter what we get out of this

I know

I know we&#8217;ll never forget

Smoke on the water

fire in the sky

 

Smoke on the water

Check ignition and may God's love be with you (1, lift off)

"This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare"

"This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

"For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much" - "She knows.

"Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you..."

"Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"</td>

Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree, ho
Love to kick my feet 'way down the shallow water
Shoo, fly, dragonfly, get back, you mother
Pick up a flat rock; skip it across Green River
Well!

Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat-car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said, "You're gonna find the world be smolderin'
And if you get a-lost, come on home to Green River"
Well!

All duded up for Saturday night

Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes 
And said, "Anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake?
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
I got a bottle of rose, so let's try it

"We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe
And I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light
Ooh, and they dance like spirits in the night"

In the night
Oh, you don't know what they can do to ya
Spirits in the night
Oh, in the night
Stand right up now and let it shoot through ya

Well now wild young Billy was a crazy cat
And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, "Trust some of this, it'll show you where you're at 
Or at least it'll help you really feel it"

Well by the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her, 'cause I was to loose to fake
I said, "I'm hurt," she said, "Honey, let me heal it"

And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice
Just as soft as a spirit in the night

In the night
Oh, Janey don't know what she do to ya
Like a spirit in the night
All night
Stand right up now and let it shoot through me

Well now the night was bright and the stars threw light 
On Billy and Davy dancing in the moonlight
They were down near the water having a stoned mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn

Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt
He ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt
Singin' our birthday song

Janey said it was time to go 
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row 
Felt so right
Together we moved like spirits in the night

In the night
Oh you don't know what they can do to ya
Them spirits in the night
All night
Oh stand right up and let it shoot through ya
Like a spirit in the night

I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed it all
If her hair was still red
Her folks, they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the east coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
Split up on a dark, sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
"We'll meet again someday on the avenue"
Tangled up in blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I's lucky for to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the sight of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said, "Tell me, don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the caf&#233;s at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going back again
I got to get her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't what they do with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view

He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy

But it's better than drinking alone

And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"

Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da

Driving me insane

You gotta listen to my words

Heirs of a cold war

Inheriting troubles
I'm mentally numb

Crazy
I just cannot bear
I'm living with something
That just isn't fair

She introduced me to her favourite books, gave me clothes, and my first cigarette
Sometimes we would head down to Blackbirds moor to watch the barges on Grand Union in the twilight
She said "The water has no memory"
For a few months everything about our lives was perfect
It was only us, we were inseparable
But gradually she passed into another distant part of my memory
Until I could no longer remember her face, her voice, even her name

Music by Gilmour  

Lyrics by Gilmour / Samson 

&#184;&#232;&#180;&#202;&#214;&#198;&#215;&#247;:&#200;&#203;&#214;&#174;&#179;&#245;

High Hopes&#213;&#226;&#202;&#215;&#184;&#232;&#202;&#199;Pink Floyd&#181;&#196;&#215;&#168;&#188;&#173;Division Bell&#192;&#239;&#181;&#196;&#181;&#218;11&#202;&#215;

Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled 
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Though down this road we've been so many times
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist growing
The water flowing
The endless river
Forever and ever

Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

Title: Fix You
Album: X &amp; Y

---------------
---------------
---------------

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse?

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you leave something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worst?

Lights will guide you home,
And ignite your bones,
And I will try to fix you,

High up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down on your face
And I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

A soldier on my own, I don't know the way
I'm riding up the heights of shame
I'm waiting for the call, the hand on the chest
I'm ready for the fight, and fate

The sound of iron shocks is stuck in my head,
The thunder of the drums dictates

The rhythm of the falls, the number of deaths
The rising of the heights, ahead

From the dawn of time to the end of days
I will have to run, away
I want to feel the pain and the bitter taste
Of the blood on my lips, again

This steady burst of snow is burning my hands,
I'm frozen to the bones, I am
A million mile from home, I'm walking away
I can't remind your eyes, your face</td>

Were hidden under the grid
Young and naive, I never believed
That love could be so well hid
With regret, I'm willing to bet
And say the older you get
It gets harder to forgive
And harder to forget

It gets under your shirt
Like a dagger at work
The first cut is the deepest
But the rest still flipping hurt
You build your heart of plastic
Get cynical and sarcastic
And end up in the corner on your own

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no

So what's the point in getting your hopes up
When all you're ever getting is choked up?
When you're coked up
And can't remember the reason why you broke up?
You call her in the morning
When you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road

'Cause when you're apart you don't want to mingle
When you're together you wanna be single
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
That made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
With those rose tinted glasses
But the butterflies, they flutter by and leave us on our arses

'Cause I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in if it wasn't for my ear infection
'Cause all I wanna do is try to make a connection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

Oh, I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction

I'd love to feel loved but I can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
And I thought I was close but under further inspection
It seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh oh

It seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Seems like I'm running in the wrong direction, oh oh
Well it seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no
Seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh</td>

She arrived one February morning, pale and shellshocked, from past lives I could not imagine
She was 3 years older than me, but in no time we became friends
We'd listen to her mix tapes; Dead Can Dance, Felt, This Mortal Coil...
She introduced me to her favourite books, gave me clothes, and my first cigarette
Sometimes we would head down to Blackbirds moor to watch the barges on Grand Union in the twilight
She said "The water has no memory"
For a few months everything about our lives was perfect
It was only us, we were inseparable
But gradually she passed into another distant part of my memory
Until I could no longer remember her face, her voice, even her name

We have got, we have got the perfect life</td>

Pinch your momma on the booty
Kick your dog, fuck your bitch

We will cut a frowny face in your chest, little wench

Flame your crew quicker than Trump fucks his youngest

I rob Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Linus and Lucy
Put coke in the doobie, roll woolies to smoke with Snoopy
I still remain that dick grabbin' slacker that spit a loogie
Cause the toter of the toolie'll murder you friggin' Moolies

Top billin', come cops some villainous shots is blocked
Shipped out, and bought, and y'all feeling it

What more can I say? We top billin' it
Valiant without villainy
Viciously foul victory
Burn towns and villages
Burning looting and pillaging

Murderers try to hurt us we curse them and all their children
I just want the bread and bologna bundles to tuck away
I don't work for free, I am barely giving a fuck away

So tell beggin' Johnny and Mommy to get the fuck away
Heyyo here's a gun, son, now run, get it the gutterway
Live to shoot another day

But I still wonder why
You left with her
And left me behind

Take your hands off him
'Cause he's the only one that I have ever loved
And please don't find her skin
When you turn the lights out

I can't erase it
From my mind
I just replay it, love
Think of it all of the time

But I don't want to imagine
Words you spoke to her that night
Naked bodies look like porcelain
You both know I'd be bleeding inside

Did she make your heart beat faster than I could?
Did she give you what you hoped for?
Oh nights so loveless, love
I hope it made you feel good
Knowing how much I adored you</td>

I think we should run, run, run, run

And we will step outside, checking that the coast is clear

But you can't see the ropes

And he won't tell his folks, 'cause they're already ghosts

Until we reach the border, until we make our plan
To run, run, run, run

To run, run, run, run

Will you stay with me my love, for another day
'Cause I don't want to be alone, when I'm in this state
Will you stay with me my love, 'til we're old and grey
I don't want to be alone, when these bones decay
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

While I powder my nose, he will powder his gums
And if I try to get close, he is already gone
I don't know what we're doing, I don't know what we've done
But the fire is coming, so I think we should run</td>

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they make a club and beat their brother down

Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability
To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here

Fight over life, over blood, over air and light
Over love, over sun, over another
Fight for the time, for the one, for the rise and

Benched along with patience and reason

Make the tea and the soup

And all their school books and their running shoes
Washing them clean in the dirty steel sink

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Concentrates my mind
Helps me to sleep

Keep making beds, keep the cat fed
Open the windows, let the air in
Keep the house clean, keep the routine
Paintings they made still stuck to the fridge

Keep cleaning, keep ironing
Cooking their meals on the stainless steel hob
Keep washing, keep scrubbing
Long until the dark comes to bruise the sky
Deep in the debt to night

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Helps me to sleep

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Helps me to sleep

The most beautiful morning forever
Like the ones from far off, far off away
With the hum of the bees in the jasmine sway

Try to let go
Don't ever let go
Try to let go
Don't ever</td>

Robin Thicke:
If you can&#8217;t hear what I&#8217;m trying to say
If you can&#8217;t read from the same page
Maybe I&#8217;m going death, maybe I&#8217;m going blind
Maybe I&#8217;m out of my mind

Pre-chorus:
Ok now he was close, tried to domesticate you
But you&#8217;re an animal, baby it&#8217;s in your nature
Just let me liberate you

Hey, hey, hey
Than man is not your maker

Chorus:
And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m gon&#8217; take a good girl,
I know you want it

Can&#8217;t let it get passed me
You&#8217;re far from plastic
Talk about getting blasting
I hate these blurred lines
I know you want it
I know you want it
I know you want it
But you&#8217;re a good girl
The way you grab me
Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

Verse 2: Robin Thicke
What do they make dreams on
When you got them jeans on

Robin Thicke
I feel so lucky, you wanna hug me
Hey, hey, hey
What rhymes with hug me?
Hey, hey, hey

Pre-chorus:
Ok now he was close, tried to domesticate you

Verse 3: T.I.
One thing I ask you
Let me be there when you &#8230; that ass too
Yo, from Malibu, to Paribu
Yeah, had a big machine daddy
So hit me up when you pass through
I&#8217;ll give you something big enough to take your ass too
Swag on, when when you dress casual
I mean it&#8217;s not most unbearable
Then, honey you&#8217;re not there when I&#8217;m
With my foresight b*tch you pay me by
Nothing like your leg, I ain&#8217;t too square for you
I&#8217;ll smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I jail watch, hand wave for you to salute
But you didn&#8217;t pick
Not many women get a &#8230;
But I&#8217;m a nice guy, but you get it if you get with me

Robin Thicke:
Shake the vibe, get down, get up,
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
Watcha doing like word

Baby can you breathe? I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me Dakota to Dakata, uh huh
No more pretending,
Hey, hey, hey
Cause now you winning
Hey, hey, hey

Chorus:
I always wanted a good girl,
I know you want it

Leaving the ground for the lovers.
Cast away back for the better days,
When I knew it was easy to lie,
When I'd only one hand for goodbyes, then.

I slipped under the empty bed,
Got lost inside the dark hollows.
It's the black of your lenses I still can't see through.
And if you had been looking at me,
Then you'd know I'd intended to leave, here.

I don't get to make you nervous. But I got to, tonight.
I don't mean to make you nervous, I'm gonna have to, this time. 

I've gotta know we're better here than we were last year.

I can never just say what I mean,
Can only manage to say something similar.
If my tongue wasn't moored to the bow of my lips
Then I'd surely be able to say,
That our black and white has become grey. 

I don't get to make you nervous. But I got to, tonight.
I don't mean to make you nervous, I'm gonna have to, this time.</td>

You never could get it unless you were fed it
And now you're here and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you and you don't know why

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why

And I don't know why
Why

Yeah... Ha Ha!
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cos I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hearable
What appears in you is a clearer view cos you're too crazy
Lifeless
To know the definition for what life is
Priceless
For you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?
Gunsmokin' righteous with one token
Psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless,but not for long

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence the basics
Without it you make it
Allow me to make this
Child, like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child and beast
Every cloud you see
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russ, though not his muscles but the percussion heprovides
with me as a guide
But y'all can see me now cos you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'm gonna stick around with Russ and be a mentor
With a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought were dead
No squealing, remember
(that it's all in your head)

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

It's coming on

It's coming on

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before, I knew you

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch

It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?

And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

The thunder of the drums dictates

The rhythm of the falls, the number of deaths
The rising of the heights, ahead

From the dawn of time to the end of days
I will have to run, away
I want to feel the pain and the bitter taste
Of the blood on my lips, again

This steady burst of snow is burning my hands,
I'm frozen to the bones, I am

Makes me say "Oh, my Lord"

With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet

A super dope homeboy from the Oak town
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

Look at my eyes, man

Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics
(You can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks, advance
You gotta like that, now, you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat

While it's rollin', hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that

Cold on a mission so fall them back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

Yo, I told you

Why you standin' there, man?
(You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka

Give me a song or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' about the Hammer, you talkin' about a show

That's hype and tight
Singers are sweatin' so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the nineties to burn

The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit
That's word because you know
You can't touch this, you can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Go with the funk, it is said
If you can't groove to this
Then you probably are dead

So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair

This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump

Yeah
(You can't touch this)
Look, man
(You can't touch this)

You better get hype, boy
Because you know you can't

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

Break it down
Stop, Hammer time

Every time you see me
The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic

Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's "Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo, Hammer"
And the rest can go and play

You can't touch this

To trust the divinity of all the guides
And what the hell they have planned for us.
I cry for the creatures who get left behind

And if you wish to survive
You will find the guide inside.
I go back and forth every single day
The clarity that comes to me in a choppy way
As the feelings
And the places
And the seasons change
The galaxies remain.
Energy fields cone the body in space.
The angels that are coming from a spiritual waste.
The hate that gets me distant from my spiritual pace.

My fear is this is talking shit
And I am wide awake and I am taking names.Do you speak to me like you speak to God?
All the love and understanding between the father and the son?
Do you believe in the perfectness of where you are?
He's my people he's my children it's the land that I would fight for.
I saw an ebonese telling me to patiently move the music medicine around the planet in a hurry.

I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take

One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
But no one gives us any time anymore

He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it then you ran off
I've got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?

Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time

He sees right through me it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he will fall

One thousand lonely stars, hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't want to sing anymore

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?

When worlds collide, and days are dark

You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

I know i'd never be me
without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all... together
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Or face it all together
At skyfall
LET THE SKY FALL!

We will stand tall...
AT SKY FALL....</td>

When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go
Don't let go
...to my love

Can I get to your soul
Can you get to my thoughts
Can you promise we won't let go
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm loosing control

Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I see you baby
I just don&#8217;t wanna let go

When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go
Don't let go
...To my love

I hate to see you cry
Your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry
My love is dying inside

I can fix all those lies
But baby, baby I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I

Can I get to your soul
Can you get to my thoughts
Can you promise we won't let go
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm losing control

Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I see you baby

So I fake,

All of my wasted dreams on

Oh and I take,

The moment

I missed you
I'm sorry

I've given
What I have
I showed you
I'm growing

The ashes
Fall slowly
As your voice
Consoles me

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
(x2)

We're swaying
To drum beats
In motion
I'm feeling

My patience
Controlling
The question
I won't speak

We're telling
The stories
Our laughter
He knows me

We're leaving
We're talking
You're closer
It's calming

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
(x2)

The night will hold us close and the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone
I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

Kind to some, but not to thee
Born with a rare and sad disease
She grew &#8212; a ham &#8212; where her head should be
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
Her dream was to be a famous star
But at the rate she was goin', she wasn't going fa-a-ar
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Her father was a simple man (Duh!)
He wanted to help, "in any way that I can!"
Home from school, he watched his daughter cry
In the yard, he cursed God and fired at the sky
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
Her dreams in the sky, her father felt her pain
And as he shot at the clouds, it began to rain
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Got a call from the doctor
He had some amazing news for her
He just developed a cure
If she hurried over now, he'd try it out on her
Burst out the door, she was beaming
Among the raindrops her happy tears were streaming
Finally freed from her pain
But something else fell with the rain
A stray bullet shot by her father
Aimlessly nested inside her
She fell to the the sidewalk, now empty
Of the life which once christened her body
"Nurse, s-she's... she's gone."
"O-oh... oh dear."
"I left a lunch on the table in the operating room for the bereaved, a cooked ham, as is customary for these... dark situations."
"U-uh, Doctor, what... which one is the... which... which one is the ham that&#8212;?"
"I-I must... I must go... I must... I must go, I'm on break."
"Oh dear."
Flowing hair, she was a cutie pie
Meaty face and a lovely eye
At her time of death
The doc said "time to eat!"
So we took a bite out of her face meat
Hamantha, Hamantha
You were impossible to ignore (La-la-oh...)
Hamantha, Hamantha
So greedy we wanted more
Soaring infinitely through space
Hamantha's soul was graced
With a glance of our humble planet
At which she was amazed
The news of her untimely death
Had spread out near and far
And through her soul, the truth was whole
The dream had crossed the bar
Hamantha had become a star
Hamantha was finally a star
Hamantha had become a star
Hamantha was finally a star</td>
