Movie grid population along with the drop down year selection is done.
Add hover effect to each grid item along with rating data and external imdb hyperlink.
Have to populate the rating data in the for loop of html generation (that data is already read from csv)

Updation:
1. Add only new rows to the existing csv of imdb-ratings. In the last column add the Year value.

Create total three tabs - movies, books and music

Books part - think of whether to just use the goodreads widget (currently added). There's a limit of 200 books in that widget. Can manually maintain a csv.

For music just read the all tracks html page from music-catalogue as a js table and group by album etc. Then sort by date.
