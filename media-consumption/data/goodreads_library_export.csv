But perhaps the best is the one named Omitted with Condescension - <br/><blockquote>There is a simply beautiful theorem which provides all solutions of the equation x^3− 6x^2+ 11x−6=2x− 2. Alas, any further explanation would deny you the satisfaction of discovering it on your own...</blockquote><br/>Having said that many of the proofs are rather dry. They are inserted ostensibly to reach the number 99 which was probably a choice made for obvious reasons. Variations like blog format, or just showing the same proof in LaTeX as a separate variation is rather dull. <br/>Each variation of the proof is only one page long followed by a one page commentary.

And an exposé of the superficial solutions ubiquitous in today's world disguised as noble actions within the capitalist and free market framework. The following quote in the opening sums up the angle in which the book's arguments flow - <br/><blockquote>“Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good.” - Oscar Wilde</blockquote><br/>After warming up in the first few chapters Anand aims his guns directly at three key players - Thought Leaders (of TED, Davos fame), Management Consultants (of McKinsey, BCG, Bain fame) and Philonthropists (of Clinton Global Initiatives, Ford Foundation fame). What is more like a disclaimer about himself is hidden at the end in Acknowledgements where Anand discloses that he has worked in all the three aforementioned sectors (TED, McKinsey and Aspen Institute). The only inadequacy I felt in the book is about insufficient emphasis on the solutions or the way forward. But asking for it may be ironic as in his attack of Thought Leaders he mentions how critics without solutions are voiced down over the noise of optimistic (but unrealistic) solutions of the Thought Leaders. Thus this book is more of a critical work. The following quote from the book provides further justification -<br/><blockquote>As I read Thomas Piketty’s masterpiece, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, I came upon a line that brought the purpose of my own book into focus. “Whether such extreme inequality is or is not sustainable,” Piketty writes, “depends not only on the effectiveness of the repressive apparatus but also, and perhaps primarily, on the effectiveness of the apparatus of justification.” That day I decided my book would be an inquiry into the apparatus of justification.</blockquote>",,,1,0,1528750369l,2020

The first chapter of the book (<a href=""https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/12/26/katharina-kepler-witchcraft-dream/"">freely available on the blog</a>) is about Kepler defending his mother who was accused of witchcraft. This excerpt is what drew me to this book. But the portion of the book dedicated to Kepler is limited to just this tiny opening chapter. What follows is a seemingly drunkard's walk through the biographies of Maria Mitchell (astronomer), Harriet Hosmer (sculptor), Margaret Fuller (journalist and literary critic), Emily Dickinson (poet) and Rachel Carson (marine biologist). As you can notice all of these are women and all of them were queer (attracted to other women in varying degrees). The biographies are replete with tragedy, love and complexities that are well captured by Popova who went to great lengths to painfully research and quote from primary sources (their journals, letters etc). The interconnections between each of these famous personalities is far deeper than one might imagine. Tracing the evolution of feminism is an unignorable theme throughout the book. Overall a splendid work of literature and labour of love by Maria Popova.",,,1,0,1541193905l,2020
