            </ol>
            <li>Provided that nothing in this clause shall authorise the President to assume to himself any of the powers vested in or exercisable by a High Court, or to suspend in whole or in part the operation of any provision of this Constitution relating to High Courts.
            </li>
            <li>(<i>2</i>) Any such Proclamation may be revoked or varied by a subsequent Proclamation.
            </li>
            <li>(<i>3</i>) Every Proclamation under this article shall be laid before each House of Parliament and shall, except where it is a Proclamation revoking a previous Proclamation, cease to operate at the expiration of two months unless before the expiration of that period it has been approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament:
