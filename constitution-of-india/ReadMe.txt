1. Earlier tried to use XML keeping an Android App development in future in mind.
2. The XML version is stored in "backups and assets/complete version" folder
3. Now the entier webpage is a static website.
4. Jquery is only loaded and used in full.html
5. Header is common to all files but it's included in each and every article. So use sublime to "Find in Folder" to replace all headers whenever there has to be a modification.
